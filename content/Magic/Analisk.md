The **analisk**[^ana] of a being is the abstract and immaterial essence that is theorized by [[Cryptothesis|whisper-mages]] to be the antithesis to the [[Psyche|psyche]].

# Description
While the psyche encodes memories, personality, and sense of self, the analisk encodes a singular drive to kill and devour. The analisk compels one to kill and devour even when needs are met and hungers are sated; to kill and devour even when it is unpleasant or undesirable to do so. It is believed that the analisk and the psyche cannot exist together in a being; they must have one or the other. 

In the progression of the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]] in [[Animals|animals]],  it is theorized that [[Psyche#Anima|anima]] is converted and reconfigured into either a psyche or an analisk. The progression is tipped in favor of the psyche when the primordial feeds, and tipped in favor of the analisk when the primordial starves.

Those that advocate for the existence of the analisk often use the analogy that the psyche is a pushing, producing force and the analisk is a pulling, devouring force. Often, this analogy is used to explain how primordials are able to use and grant magic without a psyche or anima.

# Debate
The initial idea of the analisk was spurred when whisper-mages were revealed the [[Eunomoi#Approximates|verisimilar name]] "analisk" by the [[Eternals|eternal]] [[Maw]], who describes such a word as meaning "an essence of life that begets death; an opposite".

[[Egersis|Evocators]] rebuke the idea of the existence of the analisk, as such an essence is undetectable through evocation. Instead, within primordials and soul-deprived beings is a noticeable emptiness; a hole where the psyche ought be. Similarly, [[Eidolons|eidolons]] are produced from the human psyche, yet no such beings exist for the analisk. 

No [[Humans|human]] has been found to harbor what the whisper-mages describe as an analisk.

# Footnotes
[^ana]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: While the psyche has basis in the real-world, the analisk is purely fictitious, derived from the Ancient Greek word "anālískō" (ἀναλίσκω), meaning to spend, destroy, kill. While the psyche is "breathed-into" a being, an analisk is produced from the destruction of an immaterial essence.
