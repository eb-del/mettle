The **psyche** of a being (also commonly known as a **soul**) refers to the abstract and immaterial essence that constitutes consciousness and the state of self. The psyche includes the mind (as a thinking, conscious entity), but excludes the brain (as a physical organ). Memories, personality, ambitions, and one's perception of themselves are believed to be kept within the psyche. It is from the psyche that [[Eidolons|eidolons]] (including ghosts) are formed. Only [[Humans|humans]] and certain species of [[Animals|animal]] are known to have a psyche.

The discipline of magic that studies the psyche (predominantly in the context of resurrection) is [[Egersis|evocation]] (egersis).

# Anima
The term psyche is often reserved for animals capable of mental individuality, and most often applies to species of vertebrates (animals with a axial endoskeleton; a spine) with few exceptions (the cephalopods and arachnids, for example). 

For the vast remainder of living creatures, such as insects, fungi, plants, and [[Animals#Nigoda|nigoda]] (microbia), the term **anima** is used, describing a simpler living essence. Some believe that animas and psyches are fundamentally the same with different levels of complexity, and that this complexity is responsible for an organism's force of will.

The broad category of all living beings (with or without a psyche) are called the **animate**. The remainder of the physical world that lacks any form of living essence is often called the **inanimate**. It is also important to note that while [[primordials]] have had their psyche eradicated by their curse, they are still considered as among the animate, due to their demonstrable consciousness and popularly cited animal origins.
