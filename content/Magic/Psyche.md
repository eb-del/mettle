The **psyche**[^psy] of a being (also commonly known as a **soul**) refers to the abstract and immaterial essence that constitutes consciousness and the state of self. 

# Description
The psyche includes the mind (as a thinking, conscious entity), but excludes the brain (as a physical organ). Memories, personality, ambitions, and one's perception of themselves are believed to be kept within the psyche. It is from the psyche that [[Eidolons|eidolons]] (including ghosts) are formed. Only [[Humans|humans]] and certain species of [[Animals|animal]] are known to have a psyche.

The discipline of magic that studies the psyche (predominantly in the context of resurrection) is [[Egersis|evocation]] (egersis). 

## Anima
The term psyche is often reserved for animals capable of mental individuality, and most often applies to species of vertebrates (animals with a axial endoskeleton; a spine) with few exceptions (the cephalopods and arachnids, for example). 

For the vast remainder of living creatures, such as insects, fungi, plants, and [[Animals#Nigoda|nigoda]] (microbia), the term **anima** is used, describing a simpler living essence. Some believe that animas and psyches are fundamentally the same with different levels of complexity, and that this complexity is responsible for an organism's force of will.

The broad category of all living beings (with or without a psyche) are called the **animate**. The remainder of the physical world that lacks any form of living essence is often called the **inanimate**.

# Footnotes
[^psy]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "psyche" is an Ancient Greek concept, derived from the word "psūkhḗ" (ψῡχή), which is the noun form of the verb "psū́khō" (ψῡ́χω). The word "psūkhḗ" is never used, however, to describe the act of blowing, but instead explicitly as the immaterial essence of life, the animating force, the soul; to breathe life into something, ensoulment.
