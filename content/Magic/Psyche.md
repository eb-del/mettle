The **psyche** of a being (also commonly known as a **soul**) refers to the abstract and immaterial essence that constitutes consciousness and the state of self. The psyche includes the mind (as a thinking, conscious entity), but excludes the brain (as a physical organ). Memories, personality, ambitions, and one's perception of themselves are believed to be kept within the psyche. It is from the psyche that [[Eidolons]] (including ghosts) are formed. Only certain [[animals]] and [[humans]] are known to have a psyche.

The discipline of magic that studies the psyche (predominantly in the context of resurrection) is [[egersis]].

# Anima
The term psyche is often reserved for animals capable of mental individuality, and most often applies to species of vertebrates (animals with a axial endoskeleton; a spine) with few exceptions (the cephalopods and arachnids, for example). 

For the vast remainder of living creatures, such as insects, fungi, plants, and [[Animals#Nigoda|nigoda]] (microbia), the term **anima** is used, describing a simpler living essence. Some believe that animas and psyches are fundamentally the same with different levels of complexity, and that this complexity is responsible for an organism's force of will.

The broad category of all living beings (with or without a psyche) are called the **animate**. The remainder of the physical world that lacks any form of living essence is often called the **inanimate**. It is also important to note that while [[primordials]] have had their psyche eradicated by their curse, they are still considered as among the animate, due to their demonstrable consciousness and popularly cited animal origins.

# World Soul
The invisible, semi-conscious network of both psyche and anima, permeating and connecting all living things on [[Seath]], is often collectively called the **anima mundi** or **world soul**. 

Unlike the psyche, the world soul does not encode a personality, but instead a natural tendency towards interconnectivity and defiance against death. Much like a psyche, however, the world soul encodes memories. Mass extinctions are regarded as wounds or painful memories upon the world soul. Accessing the memories of the world is important to many [[Mantis#Shamanism|shamanistic]] traditions.

[[Eidolons#Ghosts|Ghosts]] are naturally compelled towards the [[afterlife]], by an evicting pressure imposed by the world soul. For this reason [[Egersis|evocators]] often perceive the world soul as an obstacle to resurrection.

The health of the world soul provides direct insight upon balance of nature. Some classes of natural disaster are believed to be directly caused by illnesses afflicting the world soul. Nearly all shamanistic cultures acknowledge the idea that the death of the world soul would mean the total extinction of all life on Seath forever.

# Ensoulment
Not to be mistaken with [[quirk magic]], **ensoulment** is a very rare phenomena in which a being with a psyche imparts a portion of their own living essence into an inanimate object. The result is that the inanimate object becomes, to an extent, animate (ensouled). The newly ensouled object develops a simple form of will, and often that will is to be kept in the possession of their owner—hence the popular term, **soulbound**. In addition, an ensouled item develops a primitive personality based on how that item was used by their owner. An ensouled shield could become protective and vigilant; an ensouled hammer could become industrious or hard-headed; an ensouled banner could show a preference for the clean wind and clear skies.

Ensoulment most often occurs with an inanimate possession with the greatest emotional significance to their owner. Often these inanimate possessions were given a name, by their owner, at some time prior to their sudden and unexpected ensoulment. Aptitude in the use of magic is not a prerequisite for ensoulment of one's possessions to occur, and a sizable majority of ensouled objects have been owned by individuals without magical talent. 

Ensoulment, thus far, has never happened purposefully; willing ensoulment by a person upon their own possessions is popularly regarded (especially by evocators) as an endeavor that is both arrogant and futile. The exact mechanism behind ensoulment is regarded as the greatest mystery of interest to evocators—as understanding this mechanism would clues as to the origin of the human psyche.
