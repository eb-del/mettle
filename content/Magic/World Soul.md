The invisible, semi-conscious network of [[Psyche|essence]], permeating and connecting all living things on [[Seath]], is often collectively called the **world soul**. 

# Description
Unlike an individual's [[Psyche|psyche]], the world soul does not encode a personality, but instead a natural tendency towards interconnectivity and survival. Much like a psyche, however, the world soul does encode memories. Mass extinctions are regarded as wounds or painful memories upon the world soul. Accessing the memories of the world is important to many [[Mantis#Shamanism|shamanistic]] traditions.

The health of the world soul provides direct insight upon balance of nature. Some classes of natural disaster are believed to be directly caused by illnesses afflicting the world soul. Nearly all cultures that acknowledge the existence of the world soul, also acknowledge the idea that the death of the world soul would mean the total extinction of all life on Seath forever.

## Evicting Force
The world soul imposes a conscious, willing, and deliberate evicting force that weakens the presence and influence of the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|actor races]], not dissimilar to an immune system responding to pathogens.

[[Ephemerals]] born from the psyche (such as [[Eidolons|eidolons]]) are compelled to be sent to the [[Afterlife|afterlife]]â€”others are gradually eroded and returned to the [[Thaumic Field|ether]]. [[Eternals]] are compelled to return to their original [[Places#Planes|planes of existence]], or risk losing their immortality and godly potency. [[Primordials]] become subject to derangement and disfigurement, the presence of the world soul poisonous to them.
