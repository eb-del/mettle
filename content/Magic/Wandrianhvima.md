**Wandrianhvima**[^wawi] (sometimes **wanderwhimsy**[^wawi]) is a rare [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]] that represents any [[Humans|human's]] ability to absent-mindedly wander into unfamiliar place beyond [[Seath]]. 

# Description
Like all obscurities, it is impossible to engage in wandrianhvima with any amount of alertness or purposefulness. Wandrianhvima usually captures those traveling alone, sometimes it captures pairs, yet never groups of three or larger.

The exact transition between a familiar place and unfamiliar place is always subtle, as if intended to evade notice. Those that eventually notice that they're somewhere unfamiliar realize that they were distracted, and feel as though they had taken a wrong turn somewhere in their journey. It is more common to wandrianhvima when traveling a familiar path alone, yet thoroughly distracted by something new, pleasant, or leucocholic[^leuc].

Somewhere along the journey is a natural threshold—such as a tunnel, a hollow tree, a waterfall, a blind bend, a forgotten doorway—that serves as the gateway between Seath and the unfamiliar destination. This threshold is the only means of return.

# Destinations
Wandrianhvima always takes people to a place that does not exist on [[Seath]]. These places can be alternate [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]], such as those in which [[eternals]] may permanently reside. These places can be fictitious, temporary worlds forged by an [[Ephemerals|ephemeral]], such as a [[Incarnates#Liminalities|liminality]]. 

Wandrianhvima never takes those enthralled by it to outright uncomfortable, inhospitable, or dangerous locations. Wandrianhvima has a tendency towards maintaining a state of absent-mindedness and avoiding places that'd cause alarm or alertness; a tendency reflected in the destinations that people often arrive to.

## Returning
To return, an individual must retrace their steps. The threshold that originally brought the individual to this new place will have a tendency to reappear when sought after—it is never difficult to find one's way home. Upon returning home, the threshold loses all unique properties, and the specific connection between Seath and the unfamiliar destination is severed permanently.

# Footnotes
[^wawi]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "wandrianhvima" and "wanderwhimsy" are combinations of the English word "wander", from Old English "wandrian", meaning to roam, fly around, stray; and the English word "whimsy", from a shortening of the English word "whimwham", meaning trinket, novelty, subject of fancy or imagination. The origin of "whimwham" is uncertain, but there are suggested relationships with the Old Norse "hvima" (as in wandrianhvima), meaning to let the eyes wander, and the Norwegian "kvima", meaning to flutter. The overall term "wanderwhimsy" intends to be almost onomatopoeic, or to evoke sound-symbolism (the alliteration and combination is non-arbitrary). 

[^leuc]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "leucocholic" refers to the poet Thomas Gray's "luecocholy", an alteration of the English word "melancholy", but with the prefix "leuco-", from Ancient Greek "leukós" (λευκός), meaning white; thus a white melancholy. Leucocholy is defined as that pleasant state of preoccupation or distraction when doing something trivial; described by Thomas Gray as something that "seldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls joy or pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of a state".
