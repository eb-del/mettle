The **thaumic field**[^qft][^thau] (sometimes called the **ether**) is an empirically-motivated quantitative and spatial description of [[Magic|magic]].  

The [[Humans|human]] quantitative study of the the thaumic field is called **thaumaturgy**[^thau] (also known as **thaumatology**; whose practitioners are known as **thaumaturgists**). Thaumaturgy and [[True Names|onomastics]] form the discipline of magic called [[Cryptothesis|cryptothesis]].

# Description
The thaumic field is best understood as an invisible, intangible "air" (from which the word "ether" is derived) that permeates across the [[Seath|world]]. This field can have loci (also called potentials), in which the magnitude or concentration of thaumic energy  can vary from the average energy across the entire field. Unbenkownst to humanity (requiring further advances in physics and mathematics), the thaumic field is analogous to other fields such as electric fields, magnetic fields, gravitational fields.

## Sandbox Analogy
A two-dimensional analogy often used to teach the concept of the thaumic field is a box of sand. The thaumic field has a natural tendency to be uniform and flat, shown by shaking the container of sand until it is level. To wield magic in the way many people recognize—some supernatural effect—hills and divots can be made in the sand. It is considered an important fact to note is that no sand is added or removed from the box, simply shifted around and made into different forms. Marbles are sometimes introduced to illustrate the thaumic field's relationship with the physical world. Marbles represent some physical phenomena, like heat or material; multiple marbles gathering in a divot in the sand is akin to concentrating heat in [[Kinesis#Pyrokinesis|pyrokinesis]].

In reality, the thaumic field is three-dimensional. The hills and divots of the sandbox analogy instead represent areas in the field that are more compressed or stretched, respectively. The fixed quantity of sand teaches the property of conservation, when the field is compressed in one region, it must be stretched in other regions. The earlier mention of loci (potentials) describe the areas that are most highly compressed or stretched in this space. The marbles in the analogy represent how changes in the thaumic field implicitly produces changes in other physical fields. For example, [[Kinesis|kinesis']] description in thaumaturgy involves alterations in the thaumic field in order to impart force through some other (presently undiscovered) physical field, such as through magnetism or by gravity.

[^qft]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: Surprise, it's analogous to Quantum Field Theory (QFT). This scientifically-motivated "hard magic" approach is what makes the setting science fantasy, despite the fact that much of the science is obscured from mankind.

[^thau]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: "thaumaturgy" and "thaumatology" are both English words referencing the application of magic to change the physical world, particular to influence forces of nature, or to do miracles (lit. miracle-working and the study of miracles, respectively). The word "thaumaturgy" has origins in Ancient Green from the words "thaûma" (θαῦμα) meaning miracles and "érgon" (ἔργον) meaning work. Similarly, "thaumic field" means miracle field, or the field in which miracles occur.
