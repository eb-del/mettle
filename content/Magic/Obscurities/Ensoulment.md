Not to be mistaken with [[Quirk Magic|quirk magic]], **ensoulment** is a very rare [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]], in which a being with a [[Psyche|psyche]] imparts a portion of their own living essence into an inanimate object. The result is that the inanimate object becomes, to an extent, animate (ensouled). 

The newly ensouled object develops a simple form of will, and often that will is to be kept in the possession of their owner—hence the popular term, **soulbound**. In addition, an ensouled item develops a primitive personality based on how that item was used by their owner. An ensouled shield could become protective and vigilant; an ensouled hammer could become industrious or hard-headed; an ensouled banner could show a preference for the clean wind and clear skies.

Ensoulment most often occurs with an inanimate possession with the greatest emotional significance to their owner. Often these inanimate possessions were given a name, by their owner, at some time prior to their sudden and unexpected ensoulment. Aptitude in the use of magic is not a prerequisite for ensoulment of one's possessions to occur, and a sizable majority of ensouled objects have been owned by individuals without magical talent. 

Like all obscurities, ensoulment, thus far, has never happened purposefully; willing ensoulment by a person upon their own possessions is popularly regarded (especially by evocators) as an endeavor that is both arrogant and futile. The exact mechanism behind ensoulment is regarded as the greatest mystery of interest to evocators—as understanding this mechanism would clues as to the origin of the human psyche.
