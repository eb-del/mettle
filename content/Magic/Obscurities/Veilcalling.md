Similar to how [[Eternals|eternals]] can identify one another through [[True Names|true names]], **veilcalling** is an [[Magic#Obscurities|obscure]] yet simple to perform technique, allowing [[humans]] to identify eternals. 

# Description
Unlike true names and the difficulties surrounding [[Hitturpyx|hitturpyx]], any human is capable of veilcalling. To issue a veilcall, a human must clearly and directly declare a question towards an eternal, asking their identity (most commonly in the form of "Who are you?"). Language does not matter, as eternals understand all human languages. Only humans are able to veilcall.

By some unknowable and unbreakable obligation, the eternal will always respond in the language most comfortable to the veilcalling individual. An eternal's response is always in the form of "You know me as..." followed by a distinctive phrase unique to that eternal. This response will always be the same, regardless of who issues the veilcall. 

When issued a veilcall, the eternal cannot refuse to answer, nor can they answer with any amount of dishonestly. 

Responses to veilcalls provided by eternals are [[Unforgettable Ideas|unforgettable]]. Often, the vivid and potent memory of an eternal's original response to a veilcall dismantles any desire to issue a veilcall to the same eternal again. This unforgettable effect does not occur with responses to veilcalls learned from secondhand sources, such as from written texts, or from other humans.

Eternals rarely offer their name ([[True Names#Approximates|verisimilar]] or otherwise) through their response to a veilcall, instead describing the things that fall within their domain or the worldly things that ought represent them.
