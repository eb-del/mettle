An **unforgettable idea** (also called an **unforgettable memory**) as an [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]] describes an idea or memory that is embedded permanently into one's mind by means of [[Magic|magic]]—typically by an [[Eternals|eternal]]. 

# Description
When something is unforgettable by means of magic, it is remembered clearly, in its entirety, without distortion or alteration by one's own perspective. The memory or idea itself is distinct and specific; approximate or adjacent ideas and memories are not necessarily unforgettable. For example, a person will always remember an eternal's unforgettable response to a [[Veilcalling|veilcall]] but are not guaranteed to remember any of the circumstances around hearing the response to the veilcall.

Unforgettable ideas do not necessarily need to be comprehensible. On the contrary, unforgettable ideas can feel out of place, as they are the only ideas in an individual's mind unaltered by their personal biases and semantic memory.

## Excised Thought
The opposite of an unforgettable idea is an **excised thought**, describing any idea or memory that is rendered permanently forgotten by means of magic. Excised thoughts cannot be relearned, recalled, reexperienced, reimagined, or even recognized. When confronted with the idea or memory that had been excised, the human mind most commonly becomes more stubborn and compelled to defend its ignorance. 

## Madness
Many individuals who become subject to unforgettable ideas or excised thoughts are vulnerable to madness. Some become fixated on the parts of their mind that have been altered, the [[Psyche|psyche]] reacting in the same way the body does to a pathogen. The tendency towards madness is proportional to the magnitude of the mental alteration.
