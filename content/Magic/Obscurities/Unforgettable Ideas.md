An **unforgettable idea** (also called an **unforgettable memory**) as an [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]] describes a memory that is embedded permanently into one's mind by means of magic—typically by an [[Eternals|eternal]]. 

# Description
When something is unforgettable by means of magic, it is remembered clearly, in its entirety, without distortion or alteration by one's own perspective. The memory or idea itself is distinct and specific; approximate or adjacent memories and ideas are not necessarily unforgettable. For example, a person will always remember an eternal's unforgettable response to a [[Veilcalling|veilcall]] but are not guaranteed to remember any of the circumstances around hearing the response to the veilcall.
