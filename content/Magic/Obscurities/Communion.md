**Communion** is an [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]] describing the act of forming a state of perfect communication between a [[Humans|human]] and another being, typically an [[Eternals|eternal]].

# Description
Unlike [[Eunomoi|onomastics]] (and the difficulties surrounding [[Hitturpyx]]), any human is capable of entering communion with an eternal. Communion forms a one on one connection, with all barriers of communication broken, such as [[Languages|language]], [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]], or any misconceptions, impediments, and illnesses. Communion is believed to be a connection between an eternal and an individual's [[Psyche|psyche]], rather than a physical connection—literal to a perfect exchange of memories and ideas, unfiltered by one's ability to express them.

In many instances, communion can be one-sided, like when communing in prayer, as not all eternals are interested in responding to the words of mankind. In the other direction, in the context of human [[Pantheons|religion]], messages from eternals delivered through communion is the primary means for prophecy.

Communion is most often produced willingly and with consent by both parties. Sometimes, communion is produced unwillingly, most often through imposition by eternals demanding a human heed their message. Exceptionally rare is when a human forces communion upon an eternal, such as the few [[Eunomoi|onomasticians]] that can call upon an eternal by their true name.

## Naming Call
A **naming call** is a question imposed by a human upon an eternal that they are in communion with; this question asks, in some way, the identity of the eternal. Eternals, motivated by some unexplainable obligation, will always respond to a naming call. The response is always in the format of "You know me as..." followed by a phrase that is unique to that eternal. The response provided by the eternal is [[Unforgettable Ideas|unforgettable]], and rarely are humans compelled to ask the same eternal their identity more than once. 

The response to a naming call is the same for each eternal regardless of who asks the question. Similarly, an eternal cannot answer the question with any amount of deception or dishonesty. Responses to naming calls rarely offer the name of the eternal, [[Eunomoi#Approximates|approximate]] or otherwise. Naming calls are the only true way a human can identify an eternal with absolute certainty without the knowledge of that eternal's [[Eunomoi|true name]].

# Non-Eternal Communion
Rarely, communion can be made between a human and a non-eternal being, such as the [[World Soul|world soul]] in shamanistic traditions, of various [[Ephemerals#Spirits|ephemeral spirits]].
