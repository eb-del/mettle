**Egersis**[^ege] (whose practitioners are called **egersists**; also popularly called **evocation**, whose practitioners are called **evocators**) is the study and practice of using [[magic]] as a means to resurrect the dead. Egersis as a discipline also contains the study and practice of magic relating to manipulating, protecting, mending, and interacting with the [[Psyche|psyche]] (and by extension, dealings with the [[Eidolons]]).

There is considerable overlap with [[Mantis#Necromancy|necromancy]], a subdiscipline of mantis. The key difference is that once a psyche departs for the [[Afterlife]], that person leaves the jurisdiction and reach of evocators, where then necromancy is required for any form of communion.
