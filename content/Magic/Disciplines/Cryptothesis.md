**Cryptothesis**[^cryp] (whose practitioners are called **cryptothesists**, **cryptothesians**, or more commonly **whisper-mages**) is the esoteric study and practice of the fundamental forces behind [[Magic|magic]]—namely by descriptions of "quantitative magnitudes and qualitative identities". More precisely, cryptothesis is the intersection between [[Thaumic Field|thaumaturgy]] and [[Eunomoi|onomastics]]. 

# Subdisciplines
## Theogenics
**Theogenics**[^theo] describes an extreme version of cryptothesis, whose mortal practitioners aspire to shed their mortality and be reborn [[Eternals|eternals]]. No practitioner of theogenics has been able to become an eternal thus far.

[^cryp]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "cryptothesis" is the combination of the Ancient Greek words "kruptós" (κρυπτός), meaning hidden or secret; and "thésis" (θέσῐς), meaning starting arrangement, placement, conclusion, and also to lower one's voice; thus the common title of whisper-mage. See also *[[Paramnestra#Thanatothesis|Thanatothesis]]*.

[^theo]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "theogenics" is a combinations of the Ancient Greek words "theó-" (θεό-) meaning god, diety; and "-géneia" (-γένεια), meaning production, origin, generation. See also the real-world *Theogony* (*Theogonía*, Θεογονία), a famous poem of antiquity by Hesiod, with the similar suffix "-gony" from Ancient Greek "gonḗ" (γονή), similarly describing production or origin.
