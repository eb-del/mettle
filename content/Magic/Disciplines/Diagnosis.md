**Diagnosis**[^diag] (whose practitioners are called **diagnosists**, or more popularly, **memorists**) is the study and practice of using [[Magic|magic]] as a means to appraise information and recall past events (hindsight), particularly those outside the experiences of the practitioner. 

Diagnosis contrasts strongly the disciplines of [[Mantis|mantis]] (the use of magic for foresight) and [[Horasis|horasis]] (the use of magic for far-sight). Diagnosis is also distinct from [[Eunomoi|onomastics]], identification and recognition by the use of true names.

# Subdisciplines
## Scourge-sight
**Deleterodiagnosis**[^dele] (more commonly known as **scourge-sight**) is the subdiscipline of diagnosis that focuses on identifying festering harm to the body, particularly that of poison, venom, or disease. Scourge-sight is a common ability among magically-capable healers, allowing them to physically visualize the exact instance in which a person had been infected or afflicted.

[^diag]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "diagnosis" has familiar medical usages in modern day English. In the Ancient Greek word, "diágnōsis" (διάγνωσις) means to distinguish, resolve, or decide; from "gignṓskō" (γιγνώσκω) meaning to know. This origin of appraisal and insight is the core of diagnosis as a magical discipline, where its medical connotation comes second, such that with scourge-sight.

[^dele]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: Adding the "deletero-",—from the Ancient Greek "dēlētḗrios" (δηλητήριος) meaning noxious, subtly harmful—brings scourge-sight to mean identification of deleterious harm.
