**Poiesis**[^poi] (whose practitioners are called **poiesists** and more popularly **mage-poets**) is the study and practice of [[Magic|magic]] as a means to create matter. As matter, physical energy, and magical energy are all conserved quantities, poiesis relies on the conversion of either type of energy into matter. Typically, subdisciplines of poiesis can identified by their suffix of *-poiesis*. 

Poiesis is regarded as one of the rarest and most difficult disciplines of magic, as vast amounts of magical energy is required to produce even the smallest amounts of matter. It is commonly believed that all mage-poets rely on the patronage of a [[Eternals|god]], such that they can tap into another [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]] to produce the required energies for producing matter through poiesis.
