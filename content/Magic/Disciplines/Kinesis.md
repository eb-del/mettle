**Kinesis** (whose practitioners are called **kinesists**) is the study and practice of [[Magic|magic]] as a means to manipulate kinetic energy. Typically, subdisciplines of kinesis can identified by their suffix of "-kinesis". 

# Subdisciplines


## Pyrokinesis
**Pyrokinesis** (whose practitioners are called **pyrokinesists**) is the study and practice of using magic to manipulate fire. Pyrokinesis is possible despite fire's relative intangibility, as thermal energy is indistinguishable from kinetic energy at the atomic (indivisible) scale.

## Aerokinesis
**Aerokinesis** (whose practitioners are called **aerokinesists**), is the study and practice of using magic to manipulate air. The less widely practiced **meteorokinesis** (whose practitioners are called **meteorokinesists**), applies aerokinesis in the manipulation of weather.
