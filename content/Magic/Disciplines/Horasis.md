**Horasis**[^hor] (whose practitioners are called **horasists**, or more popularly, **seers**) is the study and practice of using [[Magic|magic]] as a means to see great distances away, even beyond the horizon. Horasis contrasts strongly the disciplines of [[Diagnosis|diagnosis]] (the use of magic for hindsight) and [[Mantis|mantis]] (the use of magic for foresight).

# Subdisciplines
## Oric horasis
**Oric horasis** represents the horasis techniques practiced by members of the [[Orisir#Or Dynasty|Or dynasty]]. The technique requires a seer and a vessel—another person or an animal with some level of eyesight. The horasist forms a magical bond with the vessel, a procedure done in proximity. Once the bond is complete, the horasist is able to see through their eyes, from anywhere in the world, at any time. Using horasis temporarily renders the vessel momentarily blind and partly paralyzed. The horasist is unable to control the vessel, only see as they would see. The connection is forcibly severed if the vessel is blinded, killed, or the magical bond is dispelled.
