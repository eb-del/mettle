**Quirk magic** is an [[Magic#Obscurities|obscurity]] that represents repetitive, anomalous, magical behavior in seemingly ordinary, inanimate objects. 

Like the similar phenomena, [[Psyche#Ensoulment|ensoulment]], quirk magic is impossible to predict, and impossible to apply purposefullyâ€”some scholars believe that quirk magic is the product of ensoulment by the [[Psyche#World Soul|world soul]]. Unlike ensoulment, however, items enraptured with quirk magic lack any fealty to an owner or  personality, instead simply carrying some odd property. Also unlike ensoulment, quirk magic can appear in un-owned, abandoned, or natural objects, like rocks or in water. Quirk magic is usually subtle, benign, and small in scale.

Examples of quirk magic in household items could be a garment that distorts stains in strange ways, a staff that makes an unexpected sound when dropped, or a bowl that seems to keep its contents well-stirred. Examples of quirk magic in a natural object could be a heavy rock that floats as though nearly lighter than air, a small whirlpool of water with no outward cause, or the wind playing a brief tune. 

A common superstition among [[Humans|humans]] is that magical quirks are caused by the presence and habitation of [[Wisps|wisps]].
