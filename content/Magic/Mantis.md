**Mantis**[^man] (whose practitioners are called **mantists** or **mancers**) is the study of [[magic]] as a means for foretelling future events. Typically, subdisciplines of mantis can identified by their suffix of *-mancy*. Mantis is also popularly known as **divination** (whose practitioners are called **diviners**). Mantis contrasts strongly the disciplines of [[diagnosis]] (the use of magic for hindsight) and [[horasis]] (the use of magic for far-sight).

Of all magic subdisciplines, Mantis is the most beholden to tradition and folk practice, due to the timeless importance of predictive magic. Many present-day groups of people owe their survival to the foresight of mancers in their ancestry.

# Subdisciplines
## Prophecy
**Prophecy** (whose practitioners are called **prophets**) is the study and practice of foretelling by communication with a supernatural being, typically a [[Eternals|god]].

## Shamanism
**Shamanism** (whose practitioners are called **shamans**) is the study and practice of foretelling by communion with the [[Psyche#Anima|network of life essence]] permeating throughout [[Seath]] (anima mundi). Shamanism is a broad and diverse subdiscipline with facets from other, narrower, more specialized mantis subdisciplines, such as aeromancy, necromancy, and prophecy. 

Shamanism and its widespread practice is strongly associated with the [[Farasia|Farasian]] tribes.

## Astromancy
Not to be confused with astronomy, **Astromancy** (whose practitioners are called **astromancers**) is the study and practice of foretelling by the movement of stars and celestial bodies. Astromancy as a subdiscipline has considerable overlap with prophecy, as celestial motions are often correlated with eternal influence or divine design.

## Pyromancy
**Pyromancy** (whose practitioners are called **pyromancers**) is the study and practice of foretelling by fire, either by the motion of the flames itself, or by the observation of items burned in fire. Many forms of pyromancy exist, with their own terminology and cultural significance.

## Aeromancy
>Do you ever think the wind is trying to tell us something that we don't know how to hear anymore?
>— Aeromancer Theodoros

**Aeromancy** (whose practitioners are called **aeromancers**), sometimes called **meteoromancy**, is the study and practice of foretelling by atmospheric conditions, such as clouds, rainfall, wind, and in some practices, the fall of meteors.

## Necromancy
**Necromancy** (whose practitioners are called **necromancers**), is the study and practice of foretelling or seeking insight by means of communion with the dead, either with [[Ephemerals#Eidolons|ghosts]] or—more often—with individuals in the [[Afterlife]]. There is considerable overlap between necromancy and the the soul-magic discipline of [[Egersis|evocation]]. 

Necromancy and its widespread practice is strongly associated with the [[Thanatan Pantheon]].

[^man]:[[OOU]]: The term "mantis" comes from the Ancient Greek term, "mántis" (μάντις), which is the term for a soothsayer. This relates to the Ancient Greek term "manteíā" (μᾰντείᾱ) meaning divination, from which the Latin -mantīa is derived, and by extension the English -mancy suffix.
