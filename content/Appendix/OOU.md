The concept of **out-of-universe** information (often abbreviated as **OOU**) represents any information that exists outside the *Make & Mettle* setting—characters within this setting will never have the possibility of accessing OOU information. The term contrasts **in-universe** information. Out-of-universe information is most often used when discussing real-world inspirations, etymology, background research, or anything that does not exist inside the *Make & Mettle* universe.

The milk symbol ![[Uyu.svg|12]] is also used to represent out of universe information. The korean word for milk "uyu" (우유; pronounced "oo-yoo") resembles the acronym "OOU" when read out.

It is worth noting that there is information that is not necessarily out-of-universe, but is omniscient to the state of the world, such as a vast majority of the information presented here.

# Annotation
Information that is out of world should be shared in the footnotes, under the header `# Footnotes`. Each footnote is prefaced by `[[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**` See below[^b] for an example.
