The central narrative within *Soltide* is described by a series of **themes** that serve as the backbone to make the world design more cohesive.

# Core Theme
The core theme of the *Soltide* setting is the the **gamble**. Life on [[Seath]] is difficult; survival is the primary concern for a vast majority of people, with comfort and prestige being easily-lost luxuries. The gamble describes the idea that individuals (primarily [[Humans|humans]]) can escape the natural state of the world (fate, luck, circumstance) by risking a part of themselves for the reward of extraordinary [[Magic|magical]] powers. 

The end result, however, is that access to magic imposes a strict (and often unknowing) responsibility for one's own outcome in the world. Sorcerers are not entitled miracles, as they are expected to make their own. For some, participating in the gamble is worth any and all trouble that comes with it. For others, it is hubris and nemesis.

## Eternal Contest
One of the central sources of cooperation and conflict within the world of *Soltide* is the relationship between the **actor races** (the [[Eternals|eternals]], [[Ephemerals|ephemerals]], and [[Primordials|primordials]]) and the **agent races** (the natural, [[Psyche#anima|animate]] inhabitants of Seath:  the [[Plants|plants]], [[Animals|animals]], and [[Humans|humans]]). 

The world is [[World Soul#Evicting Force|naturally inhospitable]] towards the actor races, evicting, enfeebling, or outright destroying them. For various reasons, however, the actor races still toil and persist to keep some hold, purchase, or influence upon Seath. 

A common method of keeping this hold is for the actor races to offer supernatural abilities in exchange for service or representation from the agent races. The eternals often form [[Pantheons|systems of worship]]; the ephemerals often form individual, fleeting relationships; and the primordials often form blood pacts with [[Lineages|human lineages]].


# Secondary Themes
## Karma
Cruelty to others, cruelty to the world, and cruelty to oneself are always, in some way, punished. This is especially true for individuals who use cruelty to make short-term gains or to pursue foolish ambitions. On the other end of the spectrum, kindness, sincerity, and integrity are often rewarded, indirectly, by some karmic force. 

## Nature and Industry
The world itself has a measure of willpower, in that it exudes a strong resilience against being exploited, over-harvested, or its balance being abused. Mythical beasts, cataclysmic weather, and other forces of nature act as enforcers against those that seek to take more than their fair share. This constant contest for between civilization and its environment is a common source of conflict—and makes participation in the eternal contest all the more alluring.

The times in which either humanity or the environment overwhelming prevails, should constantly provide conflicting perspectives and mixed sentiment.

## Death and Immortality
Death is a common source of motivation. Many individuals, particularly those in power, see immortality as a goal worth dreaming about. By extension, humanity often likes to have its legacy preserved beyond death, to hoard memory, to create swathes of wealth for their future generations to prosper from. The extremes of this pursuit often provides proportional strain and difficulty on a character or group. When a character pushes against death, death pushes back twice as hard.  This contrasts individuals who embrace death, facing it without fear (even without the promise of an afterlife), unknowingly being rewarded with long life and peace.

## Soul and Self
The soul (known as a [[psyche]]) is something more tangible in this setting. It encodes the memories, personality, and identity of an individual. The soul can be altered, extracted, shared, and manipulated, naturally or through a branch of magic called [[Egersis|evocation]]. True death occurs when the soul departs for the [[Afterlife|afterlife]] or is quickly destroyed. Madness occurs when the soul is damaged or is eroded away, leaving behind a living husk.

To reconcile one's physical characteristics in order to match that of the soul is a common individual pursuit. This could be manifest in topics of growth and development; cowardice into heroism; the burden of disfiguration; and the affirmation of personal identity.

## Cancer
In medicine, cancer is described as the natural processes of one's cells malfunctioning, such that they consuming, growing, and multiplying disproportionately, exuding a burden on the body as a whole. In a similar vein, cancer as a narrative theme can be described as a natural, often necessary force compelled and distorted into unrestrained, involuntary, and worsening abuse. Cancer is the cost of insatiability, describing the most natural form of betrayal against oneself.

For example, an animal's hunger is a natural and beneficial encouragement towards staying fed. In contrast, a [[Primordials|primordial's]] hunger is distorted into something persistent, gluttonous, and decoupled from actual nourishment—it is a source of suffering as a cost for longevity and power.

## Names
Names have greater value in this setting than in the real world. Names are that which discerns something significant from something insignificant. To grant something (particularly something inanimate) a name is not a trivial matter, with consequences such as [[Ensoulment|ensoulment]].

## Words and Power
The idea that words and language have either tremendous power or no power at all is a reoccurring theme in this setting, as the idea of a common language is still in its infancy. Many groups of people in the world are divided and lack the capacity for communication. As a result, universal means of sharing ideas—such as violence and mercy; kindness, and cruelty—are often the only solution towards survival.
