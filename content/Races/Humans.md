**Humans** are an adaptive and prolific [[Races|race]] of society-forming people, known for their use of [[Technologies|technology]] and their construction of sprawling settlements. 

# Origin
Overall, the origin of humanity is unclear to the people of the present world. 

A common theory of creation is that the very first humans are believed to have sprouted from the ground in familial clusters like tubers, beginning the legacy of their race already divided into clans and tribes. In contrast, some [[Egersis|evocators]] believe that humanity ascended and evolved from vertebrate [[animals]], as both are similar in the fundamental construction of their [[psyche]]. Some [[Mantis#Prophecy|prophets]] proclaim that humanity is a gift upon the world, ushered in by the work of their chosen [[Eternals|eternal]].

# Common Features
There are many physical features that are common across all humans. These features are sometimes called **[[Harthwrichts|harthwritic]] features**. These features also describe the traits that are commonly transferred and intermingled in the offspring of mixed-subrace unions. 

Harthwritic features include pigmentation (hair color, eye color, skin color; discolorations such as freckles and eye circles), facial structures, hair length, prevalence of facial hair, and others. Non-harthwritic features include the antlers of the [[Barasingh]], the stature of the [[Eoten]], and the bear forms of the [[Ungin]].

# Subraces
Humans have a great number of subraces, a quality attributed to their innate physical adaptability, and the malleability of their psyche.
