**Ephemerals** are an abstract and diverse [[Races|race]], known for their their transient nature, some with lifespans as little as a few moments. Ephemerals include [[eidolons]] (ghosts) as their most familiar subraces.

# Subraces
Unlike [[humans]] or [[animals]], ephemeral subraces do not reflect a physical classification, but rather a more general classification formed on the basis of an ephemeral's nature and origin (and by extension, their raison d'Ãªtre; reason for being). 

- [[Eidolons]], phantoms and ghosts
- [[Incarnates]], echoes of the human condition
- [[Wisps]], sprites and motes

## Spirits
Spirits are a broad classification within the ephemeral subraces, describing more independent, conscious, and free-willed beings. Spirits are not as beholden to their given nature as other subraces of ephemeral, capable of individual growth and development. Many spirits were previously [[Eidolons|ghosts]] or [[eternals]], having shed any semblance or recollection of their past lives to be reborn into a new mode of existence.
