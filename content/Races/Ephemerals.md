**Ephemerals** are an abstract and diverse [[Races|race]], known for their their transient nature, some with worldly tenures as short as a few moments. Ephemerals include [[eidolons]] (ghosts) as their most familiar subraces.

# Subraces
Unlike [[Humans|humans]] or [[Animals|animals]], ephemeral subraces do not reflect a physical classification, but rather a more general classification formed on the basis of an ephemeral's nature and origin (and by extension, their raison d'Ãªtre; reason for being). 

- [[Eidolons]], phantoms and ghosts
- [[Incarnates]], echoes of the human condition
- [[Wisps]], sprites and motes

## Spirits
Spirits are a broad classification within the ephemeral subraces, describing more independent, conscious, and free-willed beings. Spirits are not as beholden to their given nature as other subraces of ephemeral, capable of individual growth and development. 

Though spirits tend to have longer worldly tenures than other types of ephemeral, the most venerable of spirits survive only a decade before dissolution.
