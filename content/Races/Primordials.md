**Primordials** (also known as **trickster beasts**) are a venerable and monstrous [[Races|race]], known for their colossal size, ancient curse, and the blood pacts they make with [[Humans|human]] [[Lineages|lineages]]. Primordials are often better recognized by their most populous subrace, the chimeras.

# Description

## Primordial Curse
Primordials are believed to have once been normal [[Animals|animals]], corrupted by an ancient, [[Magic|magical]] affliction of unknown origin known as the **primordial curse**. 

The primordial curse drastically alters an animal's physiology and gradually replaces their [[Psyche#Anima|anima]] and [[Psyche|psyche]] with a vacuous, insatiable hunger. These afflicted animals engorge themselves on their diet of choice while absorbing vast swathes of ambient magic. Soon, a threshold is reached where the afflicted animal has consumed enough mass and magic to awaken and become a sentient (yet soul-less) primordial.

Without a psyche, a primordial's body becomes subject to a form of corruption; a cancer. In humans and certain species of animal, the psyche is the tether that connects one's will and identity to their physical form. With that tether severed, the body and mind fail to reconcile, assailed by the [[World Soul#Evicting Force|pressure]] of the [[World Soul|world soul]], leading to mutation and madness. The only force keeping this natural progression at bay is for the primordial to feed relentlessly for the rest of its life. Never will a primordial's hunger be sated again. 

Primordials have learned to use what remains of their cunning and self-control to bind human bloodlines into multigenerational servitude, offering access to magic and wisdom in exchange.

# Subraces
## Chimeras 
**Chimeras** are the most common form of primordial, often characterized as creatures made from a combination of various animal features. Chimeras sometimes have multiple heads. Chimeras are usually identified and labeled by the species of their original animal (i.e. a horse chimera is a primordial horse that became chimeric with other animals features).

## Purebloods
Pureblooded primordials are the non-chimera primordials, seen as colossal versions of their animal counterparts. They are known for having unique feeding patterns that have allowed them to avoid the more common chimeric mutation of other primordials.
