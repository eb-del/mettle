**Eternals** (referenced popularly by [[Humans|humans]] as **gods**) are a timeless and powerful [[Races|race]] from other [[Places#Planes|planes of existence]], known for their immortality and role in [[Pantheons|religion]]. 
 

# Description
All eternals operate on separate planes of existence to the [[Seath|world]], abiding by different rules and different modes of being. Eternals are the most variable in their scope and ability, with some being singular and nearly omnipotent, while others are infinite yet benign in every aspect. 

It is unclear to humanity whether their mortal perspective can capture the true and complete nature of the eternals; some eternals possess a power far greater than what has been shown humans, while others have their role, reach, and interest in the world vastly overstated. 

Despite their potential for great power, however, none have managed to overcome the [[World Soul#Evicting Force|pressure]] imposed by the [[World Soul|world soul]]. Eternals visiting Seath constantly risk enfeeblement or banishment to their original plane. Some eternals accept enfeeblement willingly to be among humanity, such as [[Gureumnim]].

## Common Features
There are a handful of features common to all eternals. 

Eternals are regarded as immortal in the eyes of humans; many have existed since the beginning of time. This is not to say eternals are invulnerable. Many eternals engage in divine, unseen conflicts, with versions of war and death that easily transcend the understanding of Seath's inhabitants.

Eternals universally have the ability to travel between planes of existence, regarded as visitors to Seath's dominion. Some are subject to unique rules and courtesies while others can travel freely. The frequent visitation of eternals throughout history is widely regarded as the source of all [[magic]] in the world.

Eternals, regardless of origin or ability, can communicate on some capacity with any other eternal, and can readily identify any other lesser (non-eternal) being by their [[True Names]]. The ability to use true names grants eternals a small degree of omniscience over humanity. Through the [[True Names#Properties|natural properties]] of true names, an eternal can recognize the constituent components of that human: their values, their language, their allegiances, their truths, their deceptions, their possessions. A common gift to humanity is to be taught an important [[True Names#Approximates|verisimilar name]].

Eternals are never omnipotent, and only one is truly omnipresent.
