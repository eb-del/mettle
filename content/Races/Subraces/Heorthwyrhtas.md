**Heorthwyrhtas**[^hearth]  (also known as **hearthwrights**[^hearth] or popularly **common humans**) are the predominant [[Humans|human]] subrace, constituting half of the total human population in the [[Seath|world]]. The remaining half is a mix of all other human subraces.

# Name
The word "Heorthwyrhta" itself is uncommon in day to day language, typically used only by scholars. Most members of the subrace refer to themselves as "average", "regular", or "normal" humans, much to the displeasure of the less abundant human subraces.

# Features
## Physiology
Heorthwyrhtas often are used as the frame of reference from which other human subraces are described. The physical variability found among the Heorthwyrhtas—such as in hair, skin color, height, build, and more—is also applicable to most of the other human subraces.

## Personality
Heorthwyrhtas exhibit the human tendency towards [[Technologies|technology]] most strongly. Heorthwyrhtas are more likely to seek, develop, and iterate upon the means to alter their environment. Heorthwyrhta pursue surplus in the necessities, and seek comforts when possible. 

Heorthwyrhta are pragmatic, adaptable, sociable, and survival-minded. Heorthwyrhta, in general, believe that contributing to a community helps ensure the survival of the individual. More reclusive Heorthwyrhtas do exist, however, fulfilling new niches in solitude where in larger settlements there were none.

Beyond a natural drive to survive, Heorthwyrhtas are highly variable in their personalities, values, and inclinations, subject more to the influences of culture, upbringing, and individual tendencies, rather than any subrace-spanning proclivity.

# Society
The name "Heorthwyrhtas" stems from the natural human dependency towards fire. Compared to other human subraces, Heorthwyrhtas are the most compelled to form settlements and  institutions. 

Heorthwyrhtas form family units of varying sizes, determined more by cultural precedent and the resources available to them, rather than any tendency or compulsion encoded in their nature. Heorthwyrhtas have no tendency towards any particular role in society, filling positions as demand arises or as survival dictates.
