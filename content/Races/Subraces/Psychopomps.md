**Psychopomps**[^pomp] are a subrace of [[Ephemerals#Spirits|ephemeral spirit]], with the unique responsibility of ushering [[Eidolons#Ghosts|ghosts]] to the [[Afterlife|afterlife]].

# Description
Some form of psychopomp exists in almost every culture's funerary tradition. Like all [[Ephemerals|ephermerals]], psychopomps are fleeting in nature, yet they persist for a far great time than ghosts. Unlike ghosts, psychopomps have personalities, individual identities, unique memories, and a capacity for emotion. Also unlike ghosts, psychopomps are not as compelled to strongly leave [[Seath]], one of few exception to the general inhospitality suffered by the [[Races#Actors and Agents|actor races]].

[^pomp]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "psychopomp" comes from the Ancient Greek word "psūkhopompós" (ψῡχοπομπός), which itself is a combination of "psūkhḗ" (ψῡχή), meaning soul; and "pompós" (πομπός) meaning conductor; thus soul-conductor.
