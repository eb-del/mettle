**Galateans**[^gal] are a [[Humans|human]] subrace, known for their outward beauty, sensitivity of emotion, and mysterious origins in chiseled stone.

# Features
## Physiology
A mysterious subrace of human, Galateans are born from statues baring the human form, particularly that of [[Heorthwyrhtas]] . Galateans emerge indistinguishable from their a regular human, aside from a subtle discoloration pattern on their skin that resembles the veins in their source marble. 

 It is impossible to create a Galatean purposefully, as the statues they are born from are often neglected, unseen, and forgotten from memory. A Galatean's age at birth depends on that which is depicted by their statue; the statue of a child produces a child, the statue of an adult produces an adult. Any damage to a statue is not reflected in the produced individual; as though the newborn Galatean is the perfect image that the original sculptor attempted to capture in stone. Statues are often made of noteworthy people, as a result, Galateans often bare a resemblance to some important figure—though they are often quick to find some level of individual expression in their hair, dress, and stylings.

When born, Galateans are naturally gifted with the knowledge appropriate for someone of their demography. The remaining holes in their understanding of the world are filled almost immediately within the first year of life through observation and company of other people.

As adults, Galateans are known for their physical resilience and remarkable beauty, believed to be idealized images of the human form. Galateans rarely succumb to illness; show a level of immunity to venom; and their skin mends quickly and cleanly. 

The average Galatean lifespan is that of a regular human's. The most venerable Galateans, however, do not die of complications due to physical age, from instead from complications caused by their unique emotional state. When a Galatean dies of wounds or illness, their body gradually reverts to stone.

 Galateans are infertile, and show little aspiration to bare or sire children. 

## Personality
Generally, Galateans have a strange relationship with their bodily needs; often numb to the physical sensation, but sensitive to the mental state. Galateans are known to be picky eaters and are often slaves to their preferences in taste; they are resilient to starving, but will likely complain endlessly of their appetite for the perfect meal. Galateans show a disinterest in sexual passion or yearnings; instead, more often, pursue emotional and romantic love. Galateans rarely exhibit physical exhaustion yet are vulnerable to losing motivation and mental overexertion. Galateans will rarely exhibit physical signs of pain, but instead will lament on the terror they had to endure in the moments leading up to the injury.

At the extremes, a Galatean's emotions can become their greatest vulnerability. Many Galateans are easily wounded by insults; quick to abandon their interests when mocked; quick to blame themselves when things go awry; and have often a potent, inescapable melancholy that worsens as they age. 

When a Galatean's willpower is on the verge of breaking (either by stress or eventually as they age), they immediately seek seclusion and isolation. Alone, when their will to live is depleted, a Galatean will gradually turn again to stone—an irreversible process.

The strong emotional states of Galatean cause them to naturally invite the presence of [[incarnates]]. Nearly all Galateans encounter an incarnate at least once in their lives.

To suggest that a Galatean is not a person (and by extension, unentitled to courtesy and kindness) because they are "made" and not "born" is considered a universal insult, regardless of a Galatean's tribe, beliefs, allegiances, or values. Similarly, Galateans universally show an innate and almost violent aversion towards any attempt or mention of manufacturing their people; of purposefully making statues to produce more Galateans. 

# Society
Most Galateans find their place among solitary artisans, poets, and craftsmen. They have a natural talent for the arts and for handiworks. Galateans also grasp aspects of geometry faster than other humans, such as proportions, distances, and scales. Many Galateans are meticulous and detail oriented, some serving as planners and advisors in great cities for works in construction.

# Footnotes
[^gal]: [[OOU]]: The name "Galatean" is derived from the Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea, as depicted in Ovid's *Metamorphoses*. The story involves the sculptor, Pygmalion, loving a statue, Galatea, with such intensity that Aphrodite brought it to life.
