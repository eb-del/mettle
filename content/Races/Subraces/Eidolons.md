**Eidolons**[^eid] (better known as **ghosts** or **spirits**) are a subrace of [[Ephemerals|ephemeral]], created from the disembodied [[Psyche|soul]] of a [[Humans|human]] (or certain species of [[Animals|animal]]). 

# Description
Often eidolons are momentary captures of the appearance, emotions, goals, and personality of their original being moments before their separation from the body—rarely do they stray from this state, as if trapped in time. Though often the case, it is not required that the human or animal be dead to produce an eidolon. 

All eidolons are visually indistinguishable from living individuals. Eidolons cannot interact with the physical world, and any interaction they do exhibit is a form of illusion. For example, an eidolon may walk in the sand, even make the sounds of the sand beneath their feet, but they will leave no footprints; an eidolon can swim, make the sounds of splashing, but the water remain still. In human-like eidolons, their outward garments of possessions are regarded to be as much a part of the eidolon as their skin or their flesh.

## Ghosts
**Ghosts** refer specifically to the eidolons of the deceased. People or animals that undergo gruesome or traumatic deaths often manifest ghosts that reflect their manner of death. Some ghosts, however, take on the form they most identify with, such as their appearance at the height of their power, or versions of themselves that they had wished to become.

Most ghosts have reasons for persisting in the world, such as unresolved goals, unfulfilled prerequisites for their [[Afterlife]], or as the result of [[Egersis|evocation]]. Eidolons that have survived long enough to have their memories of their original lives eroded away (and by their extension, their psyche), have the ability to become [[Ephemerals#Spirits|spirits]].

## Thorybism
As a manifestation of the psyche, eidolons can produce a phenomena similar to [[Psyche#Ensoulment|ensoulment]], in an anomalous disturbance called a **thorybism**[^thor]. In a thorybism, inanimate objects around an eidolon are tossed, moved, or destroyed, typically in a loud and noisy disturbance. Unlike ensoulment, a thorybism is far more temporary, as whatever temporary magic imbued upon effected objects rapidly dissipates. Thorybisms often occur in eidolons exhibiting overflowing with the extremes of emotion, typically wrath or grief. Often thorybisms are involuntary, and rarely do eidolons cause a thorybism purposefully.

# Footnotes
[^eid]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:]**:]**: The English word "eidolon" comes from the Ancient Greek word "eídōlon" (εἴδωλον), meaning a figure, a representation. The term has roots in the Ancient Greek word "eîdos" (εἶδος) meaning sight. 

[^thor]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "thorybism" has origins in the Ancient Greek word "thórubos" (θόρυβος), meaning noise, tumult, confusion, uproar. The term thorybism was originally coined by parapsychologist René Sudre. Variations of onomatopoeic German word "poltern"—such as in the more common English word "poltergeist"—were not used due to poltern's relationship to boulders (to rumble).
