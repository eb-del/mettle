**Eoten**[^eot] (sometimes called **ettin** or **giants**) are a [[Humans|human]] subrace known for their colossal stature, gentle demeanor, and voracious appetite.

# Features
## Physiology
Eoten are the largest of the human subraces, standing nearly twice as tall as the [[Heorthwyrhtas|average human]]. They are known for a tendency towards a bulkier physique—some are as wide as they are tall. They are capable of superhuman feats of strength and durability. Eoten eat a large and diverse diet, capable of consuming and efficiently digesting foods otherwise impossible for other subraces of human, rivaled only by the [[Ungin|bearkin]]. Their diet is protein rich, consisting of fish, insects, and—on occasion—red meat.

Eoten are most often born as the offspring between two Eoten; rarely are relations between Eoten and smaller human subraces productive. Eoten have a tendency to produce precisely two children in their familial units, leading to their overall population declining when compared to other human subraces. Eoten, however, are very venerable, with many having lifespans triple or quadruple that of another human.

## Personality
Most Eoten are gentle-hearted, slow to provoke, hard to offend, and resilient to afflictions of the mind. In stressful circumstances, Eoten are level-headed and resolute, often favoring direct and decisive solutions. 

The mildness of the Eoten people has spawned a pejorative stereotype that they are brutish and simple-minded. The reality, however, is that Eoten are deeply thoughtful, mindful of their strength, and understanding of the burden they can impose on those smaller than them. 

## Psyche
The Eoten are known for being sensitive to the presence of a [[psyche]], granting them an innate tendency towards empathy and compassion. This extends to animals as well; the Eoten are especially capable understanding the emotional state of many creatures. Reciprocally, animals are less likely to be alarmed by or aggressive towards Eoten.

Their natural sensitivity to psyche also gives them an advantage in learning [[Egersis|evocation]]. 

# Society
Eoten are few in number, and often stand out in their communities. Their scarcity is sometimes attributed to their nutritional demands; rarely do communities have the resources to feed more than one family of Eoten. The Eoten that fail to join settlements often live solitary lives, sating their hunger by any means necessary—solitary Eoten often create sizable gardens hidden in thickets and dense woodlands.

The sizable appetite and considerable size of the Eoten sometimes lead to accusations of baring the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]], similar to animal-like subraces like the [[Ungin]] and [[Barasingh]].

## Agriculture
Eoten, in general, lack an eye for man-made beauty, such as that in art, music, and literature. Instead, Eoten tend to prefer the emergent and uncapturable beauty found in nature; agricultural pursuits and garden-work serving as their preferred avenue of self-expression. This is not to suggest, however, that Eoten are prone to illiteracy. On the contrary, Eoten who engage in farming or gardening are known to keep lengthy records of weather, calendar cycles, and cultivation methods—many prominent agrarian innovations (particularly in irrigation and earthworks) were created by the Eoten.

Due to this preference, many Eoten families are relegated to rural, agrarian lifestyles. This placement has led to the wrongful conflation of Eoten way of life and the standards of laboring or slave classes; at times Eoten are pejoratively called the "beasts of burden" of the subraces.

# Footnotes
[^eot]: [[OOU]]: The name "Eoten" is an Old English word (see also "ettin"), which references the same beings as the more popularly used Old Norse term "jötunn" (also spelled as jotun). Both terms share origins in the *reconstructed* Proto-Germanic term "etunaz", meaning giant. The Old English term was chosen over the more familiar Old Norse term to reference the word "eat", which has Proto-Germanic roots in the *reconstructed* word "etanan"—theorized to have some form of semantic connection. In this setting, Eoten are large because they eat.
