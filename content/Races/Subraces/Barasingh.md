**Barasingh**[^bara] (sometimes called **deerfolk**) are a [[Humans|human]] subrace known for their insular culture, tendency towards ornamentation, and cervine antlers.

# Features
## Physiology
The most outstanding physical quality of a Barasingh is their sizable, many-pointed antlers. Like reindeer, both male and female members of the Barasingh present horns. A Barasingh's antlers are composed of bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, skin, nerves, and blood vessels. Each antler grows from an attachment point on the skull (a pedicle). While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin (the makhamal[^makh]) which supplies blood to the growing bone. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the outer skin is shed, and the antler's bone dies. This exposed dead bone structure is the mature Barasingh antler.

Unlike deer, Barasingh do not shed and regrow their antlers. Antlers detaching is often a sign of severe illness or old age. The shedding of the dried makhamal (a natural and un-painful process; often done ceremonially) is considered the age of maturity and the end of puberty for a Barasingh.

Barasingh are vegetarians, with diets primarily consisting of leafy vegetables, root vegetables, fruits, berries, mushrooms, and nuts. Their teeth reflect their herbivorous tendency, as a Barasingh's third molars (wisdom teeth) are developed and their canines are vestigial. Barasingh show a severe intolerance to digesting the flesh of terrestrial animals, but have no issue with fish, eggs, and insect products.

## Personality
Barasingh have a natural tendency towards personal adornment, particularly with jewelry. Customs for jewelry differ from culture to culture. The size and shape of a Barasingh's antlers are often a factor of consideration for attractiveness to other Barasingh. Adornment and accentuation of one's antlers is a natural tendency for those seeking attention and relationships (both romantic and nonromantic). Specific preferences are dependent on culture.

Despite their ostentatious self-expression in their dress and adornments, Barasingh are often collectivist thinkers, putting the needs of a greater population over the needs of an individual. Barasingh have an instinct-driven tendency to discern wealth into two categories: that which should be shared for the good of everyone (shared wealth; food, medicine, tools, weapons) and that which is best kept for the enrichment of oneself (personal wealth; jewelry, novelties, treasures, art). 

To reference a Barasingh's antlers with any amount of disrespect (in particular, calling them "horns") is considered a universal insult, regardless of a Barasingh's tribe, beliefs, allegiances, or values.

# Society
Like the [[Ungin]], a history of discrimination against giant or animal-like subraces—often wrongly believed to bare the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]]—continues to promote seclusion and distancing among the Barasingh.

As a result, Barasingh redirect their sociable tendencies inward, and tend to form units (families, organizations, tribes) with other Barasingh. In more diverse human settlements, Barasingh form enclaves, self-segregating as a natural tendency. 

A Barasingh's natural eye for decoration, either of self or of spaces, lends them to artisan roles such as jewelers, weavers, clothiers, rugmakers, and more.

# Footnotes
[^bara]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:]**: The name "Barasingh" is an alternate spelling of the English word "barasingha", referencing a real-world species of swamp deer native to the Indian subcontinent. The English word is derived from Hindi "bārahsinggā" (बारहसिंगा) meaning twelve-horned.

[^makh]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "makhamal" is the romanization of the Hindi word for velvet (मखमल). "Velvet" is the term for the vascular tissue around an antler that grows as it matures.
