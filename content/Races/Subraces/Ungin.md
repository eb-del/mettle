**Ungin**[^ung]  (sometimes called **bearkin**) are a [[Humans|human]] subrace known for their innate ability to [[Morphosis|shapeshift]] between human and bear forms. They are regarded as the descendants of the hero, [[Ungnyeo]][^ung].

# Features
## Physiology
In their humanoid form, Ungin are indistinguishable from the [[Harthwrichts|average human]], aside from a tendency towards denser hair of the head and body.

The shapeshifting process of an Ungin is magical in nature; one of the naturally occurring versions of true and perfect [[Morphosis]]. The transformation is akin to reconciling the two modes of the Ungin [[psyche]]. Ungin are best described as having two bodies to which they switch between freely: one that is completely human, and one that is completely bear. There is no middle-ground or half-changed state for an Ungin. 

Ungin experience shapeshifting for the first time in adolescence, often involuntarily. To learn how to control one's shapeshifting is often considered a right of passage into adulthood for many Ungin.

An Ungin's human hair color corresponds to the color of their bear form's fur.

Ungin are omnivorous, favoring a highly variable diet. Ungin are capable of eating raw meat in either form, though cooked meat is universally preferred. Nutrition is important to an Ungin, as their ability to maintain their bear form relies on being well-fed. A starving Ungin is unable to shapeshift, often returning to their human form (which has lower nutritional demands than their bear form). Most Ungin prefer to eat their meals in human form.

Ungin are born as the offspring of any coupling where one or both of the parents are also Ungin. In mixed-subrace unions, the likelihood of producing a purely Ungin child is twice that of producing a child of another subrace. This prevalence in genetic probability leads to a steady increase in the Ungin population, balanced only by the Ungin preference for three or fewer offspring. There are no Ungin half-breeds; if a parent of an Ungin is of another subrace, only [[Humans#Common Features|common features]] are imparted.

## Personality
Ungin have a heightened sense of proportionality of self, understanding clearly how much space their bodies occupy. Ungin have a tendency to keep away from narrow or cramped spaces, and will often give others a wide berth. Some Ungin get irritable in crowded areas or if their personal space is invaded. The extremes of this natural tendency can manifest as claustrophobia or agoraphobia.

As consciousness and intelligence are encoded in the psyche, an Ungin does not lose their human sense of self and recollection when in their bear form. In their bear form, Ungin are, however, compelled by animalistic tendencies: their hunger is a stronger motivator, their territory holds a stronger value, fury becomes a stronger emotion, and violence becomes a more acceptable response.

As distant descendants of the hero Ungnyeo, Ungin have a strong sense of individual heritage, despite their solitary nature. It is believed by [[Egersis|evocators]] that the memory of Ungnyeo is directly tethered to the part of the psyche that grants Ungin their shapeshifting ability; to be Ungin is to remember Ungnyeo.

## Dress
Due to their ability to shapeshift, Many Ungin have a strong relationship with their clothing, armor, and equipment. Ungin will rarely keep on their person anything that impedes their ability to shapeshifting. For this reason, Ungin have a natural distaste and aversion towards necklaces, bracelets, anklets, belts, and rings. Waist-bound clothing such as trousers or skirts are also avoided, favoring instead full dresses, tunics, and long shirts. Ungin in their human form often prefer to be barefooted and barehanded. 

Ungin-specific attire is often preferred. Ungin-specific attire typically involves open garments such as single-piece robes, wrapped furs, and draped cloth (such as toga or kasaya). Ungin-specific attire is easy to remove and easy to put on, for both human and bear forms. Redressing is a common skill among Ungin, in which they can remove their clothes and quickly rewear them while changing forms. More expensive Ungin-specific attire has considerations in the amount of material and design, such that it requires no redressing between bear and human forms, itself transforming either by magic or by clever tailoring.

There also exist a sizable fraction of Ungin that favor nudity, minimizing hinderances to shapeshifting entirely. These Ungin are more often in their bear form, than in their human form.

# Society
Like the [[Barasingh]], a history of discrimination against animal-like subraces—often believed to bare the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]]—continues to promote seclusion and distancing among the Ungin.

Ungin prefer isolated, self-sufficient lives at the peripheries of human settlements. Like the [[Eoten]], Ungin of this nature typically adopt lifestyles that embrace small-scale agriculture, in addition to hunting and gathering. Ungin enjoy fortified dwellings, constructing barriers of any kind around the perimeter of their claim (such as simple walls and fences).

For the Ungin that live within larger settlements, they typically find themselves in martial roles as village guards, warriors, hunters, or mercenaries. In slaving societies, Ungin are prized captives, found as unwilling gladiators and as laborers. Unlike the [[Barasingh]], who have a tendency to form enclaves, individual Ungin families rarely live in close proximity to one another.

When encountering actual bears, Ungin are treated as though they are humans, even in their bear form. Ungin lack any innate ability to communicate with actual bears, despite being able to produce their huffs, growls, and jaw-pops.

# Footnotes
[^ung]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Ungin" is a constructed term. In Korean, the word would be written as "웅인" and in Hanja (Chinese characters) as "熊人"; "熊" means bear, and "人" (Kangxi radical 9) means man or person, thus bear person. Similarly, the name of the real world Korean mythological character "Ungnyeo" (웅녀, Hanja: 熊女) is derived from "熊" again meaning bear, and "女" (Kangxi radical 38) meaning woman; thus bear woman.
