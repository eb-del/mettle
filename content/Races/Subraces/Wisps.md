**Wisps** [^wisp] (sometimes **motes** or **sprites**) are a near-formless subrace of [[Ephemerals|ephemeral]] that inhabit non-living objects. 

# Description
Wisps come in a variety of shapes and colors, but usually resemble small, floating balls of multi-colored light or fire, often mistaken for bioluminescent insects such as fireflies. wisps are immaterial and can freely inhabit non-living objects. 

Wisps are benign, lack true consciousness, yet exhibit some level of swarm intelligence. wisps exhibit an aversion to beings with a [[psyche]] or [[Psyche#Anima|anima]], often fleeing from them in the same way insects do. Wisps often exit whatever object they've inhabited, should that object come in contact with a [[Humans|human]] or [[Animals|animal]]. Unlike many other subraces of ephemeral, wisps lack a mission, purpose, or task in the physical world—their appearance and disappearances prompted seemingly at random.

Areas with a high concentration of magical energy tend to attract wisps. The movement of wisps tends to reflect the natural currents in the the [[thaumic field]], like particles in the wind.

A common superstition among humans is that [[Quirk Magic|magical quirks]] are caused by the presence and habitation of wisps. Another common human superstition is that wisps have the ability to lead people to important sought-after destinations, such as treasure.

## Mourning Wisps
In places with great loss of human life, such as a battlefield or the site of a natural disaster, **mourning wisps** can appear. Mourning wisps are bright red, far more lethargic in their motions than regular wisps, and tend to hover close to the ground, dispersing like dust in response to motion. Mourning wisps congregate in a patchy perimeter that vaguely surrounds the site of tragedy. 

At times, singular mourning wisps can appear moments before a disaster, serving as a clear warning of immediate (often inevitable) danger. Mourning wisps are widely considered a bad omen, or harbingers of terrible news.

The conflation of mourning wisps and places of great death has led to the popularity of the term "sprite", as in spirit or [[Psyche|soul]].
