**Animals** are a broad [[Races|race]] that describe the non-[[Humans|human]], non-[[Primordials|primordial]] beasts, native to [[Seath]]. 

# Description
Like humans, certain species of animal possess a [[Psyche|psyche]]. Animals are most broadly classified into **spondyles** (also known as **vertebrates**), and **aspondyles** (also known as **invertebrates**).

## Nigoda
A vast yet often invisible subrace of animal are the **nigoda** (also known as the **microbia**), describing a hidden realm of exotic creatures that permeate all things at the smallest scales of nature. Nigodas are too small to be perceived; animals are to them in scale, what [[Eternals|gods]] are to humans. Nigodas do not have a psyche, but instead, an [[Psyche#Anima|anima]]—and are considered to be the simplest form of life.

Unbeknownst to many healers, nigodas are also responsible for a vast number of diseases in animals and in humans.

# Legendary Animals
Some animals have established themselves in humanity's history, as legendary creatures the occupy the stories that are shared across generations. These legendary animals are often venerable, exceedingly rare, capable of magic, exhibit extraordinary abilities, yet lack the cunning, consciousness, and raw power of a primordial.
