**Metallurgy**[^met] (also **metalworking**) describes the techniques and [[Technologies|technologies]] involved in the production of metals, alloys, and derivative components.

# Metals
**Metals** are materials that are known for their hardness, luster, and ability to be worked (to be malleable and ductile).

The seven metals of [[Seath]] that are most widely used in present-era metallurgy are iron, tin, lead, copper, water-silver[^hg] (mercury), silver, and gold. There also exists three widely-recognized exotic metals of otherworldly origins: adamant, sidereain, and claret.

- [[Sidereain]]
- [[Claret]]

# Alloys
**Alloys** in the context of metallurgy are mixtures of various materials, principally metals. Alloys are often created by metallurgists to alter the properties of pure metals.

[^met]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "metallurgy" comes from the Ancient Greek word "metallourgós" (μεταλλουργός), from the combination of "métallon" (μέταλλον), meaning metal, and "érgon" (ἔργον), meaning work, literally metalwork.

[^hg]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "water-silver" comes from mercury's real-world original name in Ancient Greek, "hydrargyros" (ὑδράργυρος) from which the modern elemental symbol for mercury "Hg" is derived. From Ancient Greek "hydr-" (ὑδρ-) meaning pertaining to water, hydration; and "argyros" (ἄργυρος), meaning silver; thus "water-silver".
