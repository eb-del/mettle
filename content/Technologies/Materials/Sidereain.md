**Sidereain**[^sid] (sometimes known as **siderine** or **siderium**) is an exotic metal associated with [[Ephemerals|ephemerals]]. Sidereain is most known for its black, obsidian-like color and its ability to physically interact with the otherwise immaterial [[Psyche|psyche]]. For this reason, sidereain is a popular choice in [[Egersis|evocation]] instruments and in weapons used to slay [[Eidolons|eidolons]].

The exact process for the creation of sidereain is unclear and clouded in superstition and folk belief. Sidereain is believed to be naturally [[Alchemy|transmuted]] from lead that comes in contact with a specific type of [[Ephemerals|ephemeral]].
