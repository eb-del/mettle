**Claret**[^clar] (sometimes known as **clarusium** or **sanguinium**) is an exotic metal associated with [[Primordials]]. Claret is known for its deep red color, and its ability—when melted—to form stable alloys with nearly any other metal. Claret's signature red color is produced in a similar way to that of blood: by exposure to air and rapid oxidation of the metal. Unlike iron and the formation of rust, oxidation improves the strength and corrosion resistance of the metal. When forming alloys with other metals, Claret's red color is maintained, even if small amounts of claret is used.

Claret is found as a rock-like formation from the petrified flesh and coagulated blood of a deceased primordial. It is unclear to humanity how a unique metal like claret can be formed from living tissue; to find metal in the blood or urine of animals is wrongly considered a symptom of the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]]. The carcasses of animals and fledgling primordials cannot produce claret.

[^clar]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "claret" is more often associated with wine, as claret has origins in  Medieval Latin "clārātum vīnum", meaning clear or bright (clārus) wine. In this setting, the use of clārus to describe a bright red metal defeats its use to describe a bright red wine.
