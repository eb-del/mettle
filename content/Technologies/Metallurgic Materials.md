**Metallurgic materials** refer to the principal materials of interest for [[Metallurgy]], primarily metals and alloys.

# Metals
**Metals** are materials that are known for their hardness, luster, and ability to be worked (to be malleable and ductile).

The seven metals of [[Seath]] that are most widely used in present-era metallurgy are iron, tin, lead, copper, water-silver[^hg] (mercury), silver, and gold. There also exists three widely-recognized exotic metals of otherworldly origins: adamant, sidereain, and claret.

## Adamant
**Adamant**[^ada] (sometimes known as **adamantium**) is a an exotic metal associated with [[eternals]]. Adamant is most recognized for its superlative luster, resembling that of diamonds. Adamant is the hardest metal found on Seath and cannot be melted in the current furnaces available to humanity. To work adamant requires magic or divine intervention.

All of the adamant in the world was either brought from a foreign [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]] by an eternal (knowingly or otherwise), or made through [[Poiesis#Metallopoiesis|metallopoiesis]], the creation of metal through the use of magic. 

## Sidereain
**Sidereain**[^sid] (sometimes known as **siderine** or **siderium**) is an exotic metal associated with the [[ephemerals]]. Sidereain is most known for its black, obsidian-like color and its ability to physically interact with the otherwise immaterial [[psyche]]. For this reason, sidereain is a popular choice in [[Egersis|evocation]] instruments and in weapons used to slay [[Eidolons]].

The exact process for the creation of sidereain is unclear and clouded in superstition and folk belief. Sidereain is believed to be naturally [[Alchemy|transmuted]] from lead that comes in contact with an ephemeral. 

When corroded, sidereain has the unique property of producing **ghash**[^gha]. Ghash is a fibrous and fragile material that easily crumbles into an inert powder. Regardless of the means or type of corrosion, sidereain always corrodes into ghash. Similar to its parent material, ghash has the ability to repel ephemerals; its powder form is often sprinkled at doorways as a simple ward.

## Claret
**Claret**[^clar] (sometimes known as **clarusium** or **sanguinium**) is an exotic metal associated with [[primordials]]. Claret is known for its deep red color, and its ability—when melted—to form stable alloys with nearly any other metal. Claret's signature red color is produced in a similar way to that of blood: by exposure to air and rapid oxidation of the metal. Unlike iron and the formation of rust, oxidation improves the strength and corrosion resistance of the metal. When forming alloys with other metals, Claret's red color is maintained, even if small amounts of claret is used.

Claret is found as a rock-like formation from the petrified flesh and coagulated blood of a deceased primordial. It is unclear to humanity how a unique metal like claret can be formed from living tissue; to find metal in the blood or urine of animals is wrongly considered a symptom of the [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|primordial curse]]. The carcasses of animals and fledgling primordials cannot produce claret.

# Alloys
**Alloys** in the context of metallurgy are mixtures of various materials, principally metals. Alloys are often created by metallurgists to alter the properties of pure metals.

# Footnotes
[^hg]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "water-silver" comes from mercury's real-world original name in Ancient Greek, "hydrargyros" (ὑδράργυρος) from which the modern elemental symbol for mercury "Hg" is derived. From Ancient Greek "hydr-" (ὑδρ-) meaning pertaining to water, hydration; and "argyros" (ἄργυρος), meaning silver; thus "water-silver".

[^ada]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "adamant" comes from the Ancient Greek word "adámas" (ἀδάμας), meaning invincible, uncontested. The word is constructed from "a-"(ἀ-), a prefix meaning not; and "damázō" (δαμάζω) meaning to tame; thus untamed, unrivaled.

[^sid]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "sidereain" is an alteration of the English word "sidereal", meaning pertaining to the stars, with origins in Latin "sīdus" meaning star or constellation.

[^gha]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "ghash" is a portmanteau of the English words "ghoul" and "ash". This naming hints to sidereain's ability to interact with the psyche. Not to be confused with "goulash" (gulyás),  a Hungarian soup.

[^clar]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "claret" is more often associated with wine, as claret has origins in  Medieval Latin "clārātum vīnum", meaning clear or bright (clārus) wine. In this setting, the use of clārus to describe a bright red metal defeats its use to describe a bright red wine.
