A **language** is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar (structure, as in syntactical rules) and vocabulary (components, as in a set of words).

# Modality
In its current state, [[Humans|human]] language has formed two modes: oral (pertaining to the mouth; speech and mouth-gestures) and somatic (pertaining to the body; sign and body-gestures) Oral forms of communication are most often aural (hearing-based), but can also include lip reading, both visual and tactile (as in tadoma).

# Other Systems
There exists systems of communication that are language-like. Typically these systems are deficient in either syntax or vocabulary, disqualifying them from being true languages. Systems lacking syntax may be nominal (name-making) systems, such as [[Hitturpyx]], where all words in its vocabulary are proper nouns.
