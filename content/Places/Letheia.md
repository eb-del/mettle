The **Letheia** is a [[Places#Monuments|monument]], serving as the largest organized place of worship, study, and education for disciples of the [[Thanatan Pantheon]]. The Letheia is located in the heart of the ruins of [[Acheriom]]. 

# Description
To the region, the Letheia primarily serves as a hub for funerary practices and preservation of the dead, while also offering the services that Thanatan disciples are most known for: communion with the afterlife ([[Mantis#Necromancy|necromancy]]) and resurrection of the dead ([[Egersis|evocation]]).

Beneath the Letheia is a large catacomb network actively maintained by the disciples of the Thanatan pantheon. This catacomb network is also home to [[Goliath]], the primordial most associated with the Thanatan system of worship.
