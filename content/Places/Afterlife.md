The **afterlife** is a [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]] where untethered [[Psyche|souls]] ([[Eidolons|eidolons]]) from [[Seath]] are sent; most of which are souls of the dead. Not all souls of the dead are sent to the afterlife, in which they remain on Seath as [[Eidolons#ghosts|ghosts]]. 

# Description
Seath and the afterlife are two opposing planes that represent the natural duality of the soul. Seath is meant for the living, naturally expelling the dead; whereas the afterlife is meant for the dead, naturally expelling the living. 

Unlike  Seath, the afterlife does not have a [[Psyche#World Soul|world soul]].

Some [[eternals]] reside permanently in the afterlife. These eternals are often vying for the placement of human souls into their dominion or realm.
