**Seath**[^sth] is both the [[Places#Planes|plane of existence]] and the world in which the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|agent races]] (the [[Plants|plants]], [[Animals|animals]], and [[Humans|humans]]) are native to. The presence of life on Seath has granted the world a [[World Soul|world soul]], a pseudo-consciousness that seeks to maintain the survival of life and a balance across its ecosystems.

# Name
The [[Eunomoi#Approximates|verisimilar name]] "Seath" was given to humanity by the [[Eternals|eternal]] [[Cornucopia]].

# Orbit
Seath is the only terrestrial planet orbiting its star. Seath's orbit is circular, centered at the sun, and completes a single orbit once every 1000 solar days. 

## Equinox and Solstice

Seath has an irregular axial tilt (obliquity)[^tilt]. For half of Seath's orbital period, the planet undergoes a radical change in axial tilt. For the first 249 solar days of its year, the world is in **equinox** with zero axial tilt. On the 250th day, the equinox ends, and the planet begins to tilt; its rate of tilt gradually accelerating. During this time, the planet precesses, in which the direction of the tilt relative to the sun changes. By the 500th day, the planet is tilted its maximum of 45º, and its precession orients the north pole towards the sun. The 500th day is known as the **solstice**. The period beginning 100 days before the solstice and ending 100 days after the solstice is known as the **soltide**. 

From the 500th day onwards, the planet continues its precession while its axial tilt begins to reduce, gradually decelerating. Its axial tilt reduces until by the 750th day, the planet's axial tilt returns to zero, marking the beginning of the new equinox. The final day of the year is the 1000th day. The end result is the planet in equinox (without seasons) for half of its orbital period, and not in equinox (with seasons) for the other half of its orbital period.

# Footnotes
[^sth]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Seath" shows an obvious relationship to the English word "sea", reflecting the world's coverage in ocean. The addition of the sharp "-th" comes from the Latin word "saevus" meaning wild or fierce. See also the obvious relationship with the English word "seat" from Old English "sǣte", meaning to sit or a place to sit—as in seat of power (with alternate definitions of "sǣte" meaning house, or a heap of hay).
