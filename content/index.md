[^fn]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name of the setting "Soltide" has origins in two languages: from Latin "sōl" meaning sun (as well as the personification of the sun in Roman mythology, Sōl); and Old English "tīd", meaning season, period, portion of time. In-setting, the soltide refers to the one hundred days before and after the yearly solstice, characterized by cataclysmic storms and disrupted climate patterns.
