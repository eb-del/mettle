***The Sentry*** is a story portraying a [[Humans|human]] traveler's presumed encounter with an [[Ephemerals#Incarnates|incarnate]].

# Story
A man by the name of Dimos was walking along the road that connected the towns of Hvar and Osran. The road was muddied and the nearby river was engorged, as for the past few days, a great downpour had fallen upon the land. Though many travelers were reluctant to leave their settlements in the wake of a storm, Dimos was resolute on his journey.

Far ahead of Dimos was a narrow pass, carved ages ago through the region's jagged, crumbling mountains. This pass was always guarded by a single sentry, whose duty was to warn approaching travelers of rocks that had fallen onto the path. 

After a day of travel, Dimos arrived at where the mountain was split. There, he was surprised to see that the sentry was absent. Dimos peered through the pass and noticed that large boulders had fallen, blocking the path. Seeing no way through, Dimos stepped off the road, resolving to go over the mountain instead. "The detour will only add half of a day to my journey" he thought.

Suddenly, Dimos felt a gentle tug on his garments from behind. "Do not leave the road" said an unfamiliar voice. 

Dimos turned to face the stranger. There, he saw a person in leather armor with a wooden staff in hand. "The pass is blocked. I must find another way." stated Dimos, presuming the stranger was the sentry.

"You must stay on the road. If the way forward is blocked, your only option is to go back upon the route you took to get here." The sentry insisted, their face wrinkled with a stern expression.

Angered by the sentry's words, Dimos stepped from the path once more, only to have his garments tugged at again by the sentry. "Is there a reason you will not allow me to go over the mountain?" Dimos snarled.

"The roads were made to keep you safe. If you will not go back, I will assist you in moving forward." The sentry's expression eased. They then calmly released Dimos and entered the pass, where they began striking the boulders with the end of their staff.

Dimos watched as the sentry struck the boulders over and over, their staff creaking with each blow. "You will not be able to break the boulders and clear the path with that staff alone." mocked Dimos, believing the sentry had gone mad.

"You may help me, then" said the sentry, offering their staff to Dimos.

Amused, Dimos accepted, though he still found the sentry's plan absurd. Frustrated, Dimos intended express his disdain by shattering the sentry's staff upon the boulders. Dimos raised the staff high above his head and struck down upon the stone with a great and thunderous force. To Dimos' surprise, however, the boulders crumbled upon his first blow, becoming dust and gravel. Dimos tried to look to the staff in awe, only to discover that it had disappeared from his aching hands. "Sentry, what kind of magic is this?" Dimos said as he turned around.

The sentry was gone, leaving Dimos alone amidst the fresh rubble that littered the pass. After a lengthy pause to collect his mind, Dimos cautiously continued upon the road. By dusk, the pass was but a speck behind him, and the town of Osran could be seen in the distance. 

Soon, Dimos was approached by a man named Iannis. "I saw you in the distance and came to meet you. Did you go over the mountain?" said Iannis with a look of concern on their face, their breathing labored as if they had been running a great distance.

"I did not, the pass was made clear." Dimos kept to himself what had happened, fearing the new stranger would not believe him.

"That is impossible. The pass had been blocked by rocks washed down by the storm. It would take five days for workers with chisels to make the pass clear again." Iannis raised his oil lamp to shed its dim light upon Dimos' face, searching for injuries.

"Go see and ask the sentry there." replied Dimos.

"That too is impossible, there have been no sentries sent on this road. I am the first after the storm." said Iannis, shocked by Dimos' words. 

It was in this moment that Dimos noticed Iannis' armor; there was an insignia carved into the bronze button that fastened his cloak. Dimos struggled to remember if the first sentry he had met had such an insignia. Dimos raised a hand to his own head, as he struggled to remember anything about the first sentry's appearance.

"Continue on your way and make haste to Osran, traveler. The journey has made you unwell." implored Iannis, believing Dimos had become disoriented. "I shall go to the pass and see for myself. If what you say is true, then you and I are fortunate. The storm has made the beasts here unsettled and angry, to stray from the road would likely lead to a dire encounter." Iannis then departed down the road, leaving the confused Dimos to reflect on his journey thus far.

# Discussion
 A popular conclusion for the nameless sentry in this story, is that they are an incarnate: a personification of important human ideas. Specifically, the incarnate sentry embodies the safety humans find in the roads they build, and the importance of keeping such roads maintained. 
 
 Here, the incarnate had granted Dimos momentary, supernatural strength in order to fulfill the goal of clearing the path. With the goal fulfilled, the incarnate disappears, likely permanently. Some scholars assert that this incarnate was unwittingly produced by the force of will exuded by the sentries in Osran, based upon by the level of concern and consideration demonstrated by Iannis.
