***The Burning City*** is a personal account, written by the unnamed last king of [[Acheriom]] confronting a prophetic [[Incarnates#Liminalities|liminality]], days before the city's destruction.

# Story
I am a servant to Acheriom. I am flesh, I am man, I am not immune to folly.

Every  mistake I've made I can see carved into the faces of my people: how they writhe from hunger, how they bleed from war. My heart aches when my choices lead to their suffering. No single day goes by in which I doubt my place in their trust and confidence.

I've spent years rectifying the tumult born of my father's cruelty—in a way I've taken his burdens as mine. I had hoped to mend a great wound. While in many places, the sutures had stayed, there are still places that yet bleed. From those places, I fear, a rot has taken, a fester, a putridness that I am ill-equipped to wash away.

Days ago the rot had produced a most rancid puss: a riot in the heart of Acheriom. The city center had caught ablaze. The smell was unimaginable, a bitterness that assailed my skin, my eyes; it was unlike anything I had felt before. I did not know stone could burn. The people denounced the works of my father, demanded I show haste in undoing his influence—a haste I wished for, but could not afford.

I ordered my soldiers to remain on the side of patience and endurance, to mitigate the spilling of Acherian blood, to make for me the time I needed—they did not listen. They were quick to flourished their spears against the people out of an undispersed love towards my father—an insufficient love towards me, I realize. They were quick to draw blood and rebuke insults towards my father—an insult towards me, I realize. I am haunted by the outcome, I have not slept since. How I wished they all could see Acheriom through my eyes. 

Yesterday, there were rumors of an army upon the horizon. Invaders at the edge of our territory. My soldiers refused to provide clear reports, I could smell the conspiracy on their breath. In my present state, delirium and terror, I cannot recall to whom these invaders belonged to. 

In the morning I had lost my temper. An advisor accused me of illness, for showing concern towards a threat upon Acheriom's periphery. Am I sick for fearing for the safety of my people? To wish to defend them even against the rumor of danger? 

It is evening now. Moments ago, I had closed my eyes when looking out upon the city. When I had opened them, I could see the city in flames.  There were no cries of terror; the smell and heat were distant, removed from me. Thick, black clouds rose from the city at a scale that rivaled mountains. The buildings burned but did not crumble. It felt as though only the tongues of fire and the mounds of smoke were moving. The city was pristine, tranquil, yet gone all the same. Only a cool breeze accompanied me, flowing through me as if I had, only now, learned to breathe.

Quickly, I was repulsed at myself for finding comfort in the moment, to imagine myself free of burden—so reviled that I had shut my eyes as to stir myself from my delusion. When I opened my eyes again, all was as it should be. Am I sick? Has the rot of the city reached my mind and polluted my thoughts? Was this what my father saw when he made slaves of our people, spoke of them as insufferable and ungrateful? It must be wrong, he was wrong. This is merely an incursion of madness—a mark of insufficient sleep.

I need to be well rested in order to be the best that I can for my people. While writing this, I can't help but wonder how things would be, had I chosen differently, even in the most minute of decisions. 

I am a servant to Acheriom. I am flesh, I am man, I am not immune to folly.
