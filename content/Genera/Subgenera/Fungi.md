A **fungus**[^spho] (plural: fungi, sometimes also called **myces**[^spho]) is a distinct [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenera]] of [[Plants|plant]][^fungi], known for its distinctive fruit-body (a mushroom).

# Description
Fungi are regarded as a seedless (cryptogamae) and leafless subgenera of plant. Many people associate fungi with rot and decay.

**Mycelium**[^spho] (plural: mycelia) is a thready, root-like structure unique to fungi. Unlike the roots of other subgenera of plant, mycelia does not necessarily require soil as a substrate, able to instead intermingle among detritus. 

Unbeknownst to [[Humans|humanity]], fungi are more closely related to [[Animals|animals]] than they are plants, especially with regard to the yeasts being among the [[Animals#Nigoda|nigoda]] (microbia). Also unbenknownst to humanity, molds are a type of a fungi, but are presently classified as [[Thalloids]] due to the absence of a fruit-body (mushroom). Some scholars presently regard fungi as a [[Zoophytes|zoophyte]].

[^spho]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "fungus" comes from the Ancient Greek word "sphóngos" (σφόγγος) meaning sponge, referencing the pore-like structure seen in many fungi.  The word "myces" and "mycelium" are from the Ancient Greek word "mykes" (μύκης), meaning mushroom, the most recognizable form (the fruiting body) of fungi.

[^fungi]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The real-world formal separation of fungi from the plants was set in stone in 1969 AD, with Robert Whittaker's five-kingdom taxonomic system.
