**Manutoa**[^toa]  (sometimes  pejoratively called **peika**[^pei]) are a  [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Humans|human]] known for their [[Sawaiki|flying ancestral city]], unburdened nomadism, and their natural talent with [[Kinesis#Aerokinesis|aerokinetic flight]].

# Features
## Physiology
When comparing outward features between the Manutoa and [[Harthwrichts|common humans]], Manutoa are slightly taller, with a leaner physique, and a tendency towards a darker pigmentation of the hair and skin (owing to their high-altitude lifestyles and exposure to the sun's radiation). 

The Manutoa's primary uniqueness in physiology is in their internal organs. Their bones are different, lighter than that of a humans. Their muscles are highly efficient, able to produce greater force per unit of bodymass. A Manutoa's heart is highly adaptable; their cardiovascular system is optimized to compensate for drastic changes in heart rate and blood pressure. This allows a Manutoa to maintain adequate blood flow at a variety of altitudes. Manutoa have a natural resistance to forces imposed by acceleration, able to maintain consciousness even while performing aggressive aerial acrobatics. 

Collectively Manutoan anatomy reflects evolutionary optimization for flight. As a result of these optimizations, Manutoa are deficient in other areas, such as physical strength in lifting, carrying, and pushing. Manutoa are easily over encumbered. Despite being able to fly, Manutoa do not have any outward [[Ornithes|bird]]-like features.

## Personality
Manutoa are, by many perspectives, the most cohesive of the human subgenera. This leads to culture and tradition mixing with tendencies in personality.

Manutoa are free-spirited and inclined to explore. Manutoa spend much of their early adulthood compeled to see the entirety of the [[Seath|world]]. Despite their strong wanderlust, Manutoa also naturally gravitate towards home, perpetuating a cycle of venture and return. This cycle is endorsed and praised in Manutoan culture.

As their cardiovascular and nuerological systems are overclocked, Manutoa are often more energetic and stimulated than the other human subgenera. This can manifest as any combination of extroverted, anxious, over-expressive, hypervigilant, and fastidious behaviors. 

As Manutoan anatomy is specialized towards being lightweight and flight-capable, they've developed a natural aversion to physical burdens and encumbrance. When transporting items, Manutoans are more willing to make multiple lightweight journeys, rather than singular bulk movements. This physical tendency is also reflected in their perspective when solving problems. Manutoa tend to take large tasks and subdivide them into lists of simpler subtasks—less mature Manutoans become irritable when a task can't be subdivided.

Many Manutoa have an uncommon relationship with property, believing need over ownership. The idea of owning something that one doesn't immediately need seems to many Manutoa as a needless burden. Traveling Manutoa believe in foraging, trading, or purchasing what they need as they go, rather than preparing luggage in advance. Manutoa lacking empathy, foresight, and mindfulness gravitate towards petty theft and kleptomania, hence spurring the pejorative nickname of "peika" (magpies) from other types of human.

# Society
All Manutoa have ancestral ties with the flying city-state of [[Sawaiki]].

Manutoan society revolves around Sawaiki, believing the city as the great origin for the Manutoan people. Manutoans from Sawaiki are multi-talented [[Kinesis#Aerokinesis|aerokinesists]], using air-manipulating magic to fly between the city and whatever territory is within it's reach. Manutoans from Sawaiki are often tasked with helping meet the city's needs through hunting, gathering, and trade.

Manutoans who live in grounded human settlements often find roles as explorers, couriers, and scouts. Many maps in human society have been charted by Manutoans. Manutoa have a natural comfort at altitude, lending them to mountaineering roles such as guiding travelers through difficult mountain passes, or as attendants for phryctoria[^phry].

# Footnotes
[^toa]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Manutoa" is a constructed word, derived from the *reconstructed* Proto-Polynesian words "manu", meaning bird; and "toqa", meaning man or warrior. 

[^pei]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "peika" is from the *reconstructed* Proto-Italic word "peikā", relating to magpie. The Latin word for magpie, "pica", is a descendant of the word "peikā". See also Latin "pīcus" for woodpecker.

[^phry]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: Phryctoria are real-world beacon towers in Ancient Greece, placed on mountaintops in a relay. The flame of one tower would prompt another to ignite their flame. Together, a network of phryctoria served as a warning system.
