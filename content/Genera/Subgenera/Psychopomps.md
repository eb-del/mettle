**Psychopomps**[^pomp] are a [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Ephemerals#Spirits|ephemeral spirit]], with the unique responsibility of ushering [[Eidolons#Ghosts|ghosts]] to the [[Afterlife|afterlife]].

# Description
A form of psychopomp exists in almost every culture's funerary tradition. Like all [[Ephemerals|ephermerals]], psychopomps are fleeting in nature, yet they persist for a far great time than ghosts. Unlike ghosts, psychopomps have personalities, individual identities, unique memories, and a capacity for  true emotion. Also unlike ghosts, psychopomps are not as strongly compelled to leave [[Seath]], one of the few exceptions to the general inhospitality suffered by the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|actor races]].

Some psychopomps also act as extensions or servants of an [[Eternals|eternal]], particularly any eternal with some stake in the afterlife, or eternals that seek to collect [[Psyche|souls]].

Psychopomps can sometimes manifest through temporary [[Eidolons#Possession|possession]] of one or multiple [[Animals|animals]], such as in a murder of crows watching the recently deceased. Unlike ghosts, psychopomps do not need to possess a vessel or living being to extend their worldly tenure.

Some psychopomps act as couriers for messages sent or recieved by [[Mantis#Necromancy|necromancers]].

[^pomp]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "psychopomp" comes from the Ancient Greek word "psūkhopompós" (ψῡχοπομπός), which itself is a combination of "psūkhḗ" (ψῡχή), meaning soul; and "pompós" (πομπός) meaning conductor; thus soul-conductor.
