**Ichthyses**[^ich] (singular; ichthys; better known as **fish**) describes a highly diverse [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Animals|animal]] that contains half of all vertebrate creatures.

# Description
A vast majority of fish are scaled, cold-blooded, eyelidless vertebrate that swim in water, breathe using gills, and use fins as their primary means of locomotion. Unlike [[Herpetons|herpetons]] (reptiles and amphibians), the scaly skin of fish are able to grow over the course of their lifespan (not needing to be shed or sloughed). There exists exceptions to these characteristics that are still considered fish—with the broader description of fish being any non-tetrapodal (non-four-limbed) swimming vertebrate. 

## Aeroichthyses
**Aeroichthyses** (sometimes **aeroichthyles**, but better known as **skyfish**) are a distinct classification within the fish subgenus, describing fish-like creatures that swim in the air. Skyfish deviate considerably from the previously mentioned criteria for fish—their gills replaced with hybrid breathing organs (lung-gills), for example.

[^ich]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The words "ichthys" and "ichthyses" are derived from the Ancient Greek "ikhthûs" (ἰχθῦς) meaning fish. In the real-world, the word ichthys refers particularly to the Christian symbol, colloquially known as the "Jesus fish". See also the real-world study of fish, ichthyology.
