[^orni]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The words "ichthys" and "ichthyses" are derived from the Ancient Greek "ikhthûs" (ἰχθῦς) meaning fish. In the real-world, the word ichthys refers particularly to the Christian symbol, colloquially known as the "Jesus fish". See also the real-world study of fish, ichthyology.
