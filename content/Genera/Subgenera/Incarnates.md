**Incarnates**[^inc] are an extremely transient  [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Ephemerals|ephemeral]], appearing as personifications of ideas and experiences unique or significant to the human condition. 

# Description
Incarnates are among the most fleeting of the ephemerals, and are akin to performers in a play: they are living embodiments representing a particular facet of humanity, who then disappear the moment they leave one's attention. Incarnates are indistinguishable from humans; often individuals don't realize that they've encountered an incarnate until long after they've disappear. Incarnates the mysterious property to smooth an individual's attentiveness, to be naturally inconspicuous, to seem like they belong wherever they are. It is extremely rare for anyone to be suspicious of an incarnate's identity.

Unlike [[Eidolons]], incarnates are completely material, and impose an influence on the physical world. Additionally, unlike eidolons, incarnates are not born from a psyche, but rather are simply created from ambient magic, perturbed and coalesced by the human force of will; an echo of the human endeavor. Despite their corporeal form, they and their possessions can disappear, suggesting their existence as some kind of mass illusion.

Incarnates lack an identity or even any real personality beyond that which they are embedded with; they are incomplete, narrow, specific representations of humanity. Incarnates are condemned to a story or goal whose events cannot be altered. Incarnates are never aware that they are an incarnate, instead enthralled in their synthetic memories and the moment or emotion that they are trying to capture.

To [[Egersis|evocators]], incarnates have a strong semblance of a flawed or damaged [[psyche]]. It is, however, a simulacrum, and not a real human soul. It is difficult for evocators to discern an incarnate from the psyche of a human afflicted with madness. A common story that teaches of the existence of incarnates is *[[The Sentry]]*.

## War Incarnates
A common example of an incarnate is the **war incarnate**. War incarnates most often depict a soldier that does not flinch from battle, exhibits courage and duty, and follows orders perfectly. However when asked about their home, their family, their lives prior to war, their plans after war, they have no answer; only an eagerness to return to the fight. 

War incarnates need not be warriors, however. They can sometimes appear as a mourning mother in the wake of the battle, unable to find their child among the bodies. They can appear as a scavenger, looting weapons and armor from the bodies of the dead.

War is a nuanced aggression unique to humanity; the frequency in appearance of war incarnates is a direct product of the potency in humanity's emotions towards war. There is always at least one war incarnate, hidden in plain sight, at every battle. 

# Liminalities
A **liminality**[^lim] (sometimes called a **liminal incarnate**, also infrequently and colloquially a **lemon grove**) are an extremely rare form of incarnate-like being that embody not a person, but a place. They capture a depiction of a specific setting; if regular incarnates were akin to actors, liminalities are entire set pieces, stages. Like incarnates, liminalities disappear once they leave a person's attention. 

Liminalities often only reveal themselves to individuals enthralled and enraptured by emotion. Often, liminalities are mistaken for divine visions or moments of madness. Liminalities are the most fleeting form of an ephemeral, and can disappear in the blink of an eye. Often individuals exposed to a liminality undergo some great shift in perspective.

Liminalities are not constrained by time or the laws of nature. They can depict any setting, and often are of the superlative, fantastical variety. Liminalities often appeal or resonate with the exaggerated perceptions of a poor emotional state.

As an incarnate-like being, liminalities also have a simulacrum of a psyche permeating the setting that is detectable by evocators. This persistent presence of a soul-like essence discerns a liminality from most real spaces. This psyche-like signature, however, leaves no trace after the liminality disappears, thus seldom are they studied by [[Egersis|evocators]].

Many traditional, folk-belief oriented rites of passages or coming of age trials involve liminalities (often unknowingly). [[The Burning City|An account]] written by the last king of [[Acheriom]] contains a presumed encounted with a liminality.

# Footnotes
[^inc]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "incarnate" comes from Ecclesiastical Latin "incarnātus" from the components "in-" and Latin "carō" meaning flesh; thus meaning in the flesh.

[^lim]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "liminality" comes from the Latin "līmen", meaning threshold. In anthropology, liminality describes the state of ambiguity and disorientation between a state of being in the past and yet to arrive state of being in the future. Liminality is often shown to have spatial (who; an individual, a group, or a society) and temporal (how long; a moment, a period, a lifetime) dimensions. A war embodies a liminality of a society across a period. A Christian baptism embodies a liminality of an individual in a moment. In internet culture, "liminal spaces" describe liminal settings that grant a feeling of unease and eerieness because they are removed from their expected context (typically occupation). Examples include empty airports, abandoned playgrounds, a hotel hallway.
