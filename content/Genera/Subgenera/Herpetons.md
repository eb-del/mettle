**Herpetons**[^herp] (singular; herpeton; better known for their subdivisions: reptiles and amphibians) describes a [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Animals|animal]].

# Description
A vast majority of herpetons are cold-blooded, tetrapodal (four-limbed) animals that regularly shed their skin over the course of their life cycle, and have eyelids. Herpetons are most distinctly divided into reptiles and amphibians.

## Reptiles
**Reptiles** are any herpeton that is not an amphibian. Reptiles are further divided into three classifications: **testudines** (turtles, tortoises, and terrapins), **lizards**[^croc], and **serpents** (snakes). Serpents are the one exception to the tetrapodal description of herpetons[^snbi].

## Amphibians
**Amphibians** are semiaquatic herpetons that undergo metamorphosis; typically beginning as aquatic larvae with gills (such as the tadpoles of frogs), and later transforming into semiaquatic organisms with lungs. Some amphibians have lung-gill hybrids, similar to [[Ichthyses#Aeroichthyses|skyfish]] (aeroichthyses). Amphibians are divided into two classifications: the **anura** (frogs and toads) and **ouradelos** (salamanders[^newt]).[^cae]

# Footnotes
[^herp]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "herpeton" is derived from the Ancient Greek "herpetón" (ἑρπετόν) meaning animal, but also specifically referring to snakes. See the real-world study of reptiles and amphibians, herpetology.

[^croc]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: In this setting, crocodiles (as well as alligators and gharials) are lizards, as the word "crocodile" comes from the Ancient Greek word "krokódilos" (κροκόδιλος) meaning lizard.

[^snbi]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: In the absence of paleontology and genetics, there is no link between snakes and [[Ornithes|ornithes]] (birds) within the reptiles. Instead, presently in this setting, snakes are considered an exception to the tetrapodal description of reptiles, and birds—being warm-blooded—are an entirely different subgenus of animal.

[^newt]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The distinction between true salamanders and newts is not yet discovered in the setting's present understanding of animals.

[^cae]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: In the absence of paleontology and genetics, caecilians (worm-like, soil-burrowing amphibians) are considered somewhere between [[Ichthyses|ichthyses]] (fish, particularly eels) and [[Scolices|scolices]] (worms)—despite the fact that scolices are among the invertebrates, yet caecilians have a skull and a spine.
