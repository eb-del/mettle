**Household divinities** are a  [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]] of [[Ephemerals#Spirits|ephemeral spirit]], known for living in household earthenware vessels, such as lidded pots, jars, urns, and ovens, granting those vessels supernatural properties.

# Description
Household divinities are invisible and immaterial. They have very little ability to interact with the physical world, yet produce phenomena extremely similar to (and often mistaken for) [[Ensoulment|ensoulment]] or [[Quirk Magic]]. For this reason, household divinities are also often mistaken for [[Wisps]]. Unlike wisps, however, household divinities exhibit a personality, a social tendency, an individual consciousness, an understanding of property, and a sense of courtesy. 

Though household divinities do not communicate with [[Humans|humans]] through language, they often show their approval or disapproval of a human's behavior by the altering state of the vessel they inhabit. Extreme indignation by a household divinity can often lead to damage or outright destruction of a vessel.

Unlike wisps, household divinities can have interpersonal relationships with their own kind: they can find partners and cohabitate a vessel; they can have grievances and disputes; and they can organize themselves into simple societies.

The size of a vessel in which a household divinity occupies is seen to correlate to their reputability among other nearby household divinities. Lower reputation household divinities will willingly change vessels as to yield to a more esteemed member of their kind. Higher reputation household divinities tend to have more outpoken personalities and clear preferences.

To [[Egersis|evocators]], household divinities have a weak [[Psyche#Anima|anima]]-like signature.

## Samsingyo
Household divinities are an important facet of the [[Samsingyo]] faith.

Samsingyo disciples believe that a mysterious race of spirits that live within individual stars. These spirits were drawn to [[Seath]] by the union of [[Haenim]] and [[Dalnim]]. Upon arriving, these spirits became amused by humanity's tendency to build homes and small shelters, contrasting the vast emptiness that these spirits were born to inhabit. As such, these spirits would come down from the sky (as shooting stars) and choose to inhabit material homes of their ownâ€”tinier spaces, as not to burden their human hosts. 

In the Samsingyo system of belief, household divinities are not worshiped in the same way as the sun, moon, and clouds are, but instead regarded as family members, visiting friends, or friendly neighbors. 

Samsingyo disciples believe that to be a host to a household divinity (or often, several) will improve the overall household's quality of life and comfort. Good housekeeping is believed to be essential for inviting household divinities. In order keep their tenancy and good favor, good care must be taken of their chosen vessel, especially of the vessel's lid or cover. To leave the vessel of a household divinity open and unattended is regarded as extremely impolite. A scorned household divinity almost always results in their departure and the shattering of their vessel.
