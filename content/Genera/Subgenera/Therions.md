[^thil]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "therion" is derived from the Ancient Greek "thēríon" (θηρίον) meaning wild beast, animal. Its mammalian connotation is a more modern interpretation, which is seen in the subclass of mammal, theria, which includes placentals and marsupials, but excludes egg-laying mammals. See also the real-world study of mammals, theriology (an alternative to mammalogy).
