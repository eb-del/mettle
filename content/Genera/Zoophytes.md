A **zoophyte**[^zoop] is an organism that resides in the [[Genera|generic]] intersection between [[Plants|plants]] and [[Animals|animals]]. The existence of zoophytes is more born from an uncertainty and under-development in the systems that classify organisms; rather than any widespread intersectionality (see, however, true zoophytes).

# Description
Though many [[Humans|humans]] assert a clear distinction between plants and animals, there are still some organisms that reside in the grey area between the genera. 

The zoophytes are comprised primarily of animals with a mostly vegetative, static nature, such as sea sponges, corals, barnacles, urchins, and starfish[^cnid]. A smaller fraction of zoophytes contain animals that use plant-like mimicry, such as the stick bugs and leaf insects; as well as plants that use animal-like mimicry, such as the corpse flower.

Zoophytes also contain plant[^plant]-animal symbiotic pairings that are near inseparable, such as parasitic molds that inhabit and control insects[^cord] or in jellyfish that harbor algae as their sole food source. 

## True Zoophytes
A **true zoophyte** is any organism that genuinely inhabits the intersection between plants and animals, rather than from misattribution or insufficient understanding. The most recognizable true zoophyte is the [[Barometz]], a plant that produces sheep as fruit.

# Footnotes
[^zoop]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  The English word "zoophyte" is the combination of the prefix "zoo-" from Ancient Greek "zôion" (ζῷον) meaning animal; and the suffix "-phyte" from Ancient Greek "phutón" (φυτόν), meaning plant.

[^cnid]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  In the real world, these organisms fall into Radiata, Cnidaria, Porifora, and Ctenophora.

[^plant]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: It is important to note that the [[Plants|plant genus]] in this setting also encompasses most fungi. The real-world formal separation of fungi from the plants was set in stone in 1969, with Robert Whittaker's five-kingdom taxonomic system.

[^cord]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  In the real world, these are the Cordyceps.
