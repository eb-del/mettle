**Animals** are a broad [[Genera|genus]] that describe the non-[[Humans|human]], non-[[Primordials|primordial]] beasts, native to [[Seath]]. 

# Description
All animals have an [[Psyche#Anima|anima]] (from which the name "animal" is derived—despite the fact that anima is also present in [[Plants|plants]], a later discovery). Certain species of animal, particularly those with a capacity for individual thought, social connection, and reasoning, possess a [[Psyche|psyche]] instead, much like humans. 

For the intersectionality with plants, see [[Zoophytes|zoophytes]].

# Subgenera
There are a vast number of animal [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenera]]. Animals are most broadly classified into **spondyles** (also known as **vertebrates**), and **aspondyles** (also known as **invertebrates**). Another popular classification of animals is between those with blood (known as the **enhaima**[^aris]) and those without blood (known as the **anhaima**[^aris]).

## Nigoda
A vast yet often invisible subggenera of animal are the **nigoda** (also known as the **microbia**), describing a hidden realm of exotic creatures that permeate all things at the smallest scales of nature. Nigodas are too small to be perceived; animals are to them in scale, what [[Eternals|gods]] are to humans. Nigodas do not have a psyche, but instead, an [[Psyche#Anima|anima]]—and are considered to be the simplest form of life.

Unbeknownst to many healers, nigodas are also responsible for a vast number of diseases in both animals and humans.

# Legendary Animals
Some animals have established themselves in humanity's history, as legendary creatures the occupy the stories that are shared across generations. These legendary animals are often venerable, exceedingly rare, capable of magic, exhibit extraordinary abilities, yet lack the cunning, consciousness, and raw power of a primordial.

# Footnotes
[^aris]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  Ancient Greek in origin, the distinction "enhaima" (blooded; ἔναιμα) and "anhaima" (bloodless; ἄναιμα) is based on Aristotle's classification of animals, which very loosely correlated with vertebrates and invertebrates respectively.
