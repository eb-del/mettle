**Primordials** (also known as **trickster beasts**) are a venerable and monstrous [[Genera|genus]], known for their colossal size, ancient curse, and the blood pacts they make with [[Humans|human]] [[Lineages|lineages]]. Primordials are often better recognized by their most populous  [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenus]], the chimeras.

# Description

## Primordial Curse
Primordials are believed to have once been normal [[Animals|animals]], corrupted by an ancient, [[Magic|magical]] affliction of unknown origin known as the **primordial curse**. 

The primordial curse drastically alters an animal's physiology and gradually replaces their [[Psyche#Anima|anima]] with a [[Analisk|vacuous, insatiable hunger]]. These afflicted animals engorge themselves on their diet of choice while absorbing vast swathes of ambient magic. Soon, a threshold is reached where the afflicted animal has consumed enough mass and magic to awaken a [[Psyche|psyche]] and become a sentient primordial. The newly formed psyche, however, is still subject to erosion as a primordial's apetite grows.

With a damaged psyche, a primordial's body becomes subject to a form of corruption unique to the primordial curse; a sort of cancer. In humans and certain species of animal, the psyche is the tether that connects one's will and identity to their physical form. With that tether damaged, the body and mind fail to reconcile, rendered vulnerable by the [[World Soul#Evicting Force|pressure]] of the [[World Soul|world soul]], leading to mutation and madness. The only force keeping this natural progression at bay—preserving what remains of the primordial's psyche—is for the primordial to feed relentlessly for the rest of its life.

Primordials have learned to use what remains of their soul to bind human bloodlines into multigenerational servitude, offering access to magic and wisdom in exchange.

Completely starved and feral primordials become entirely and irreversibly soulless, losing all intelligence and sense of self. Somehow, however, a starved primordial mysteriously maintains its vigor and the capacity to wield sorcery. Soulless primordials thrash and writhe against their own hunger, and often die not from starvation, but from self-inflicted wounds and unrestrained, tumorous growth.

## Chimeras 
**Chimeras** are the most common form of primordial, often characterized as creatures made from a combination of various animal features. Chimeras sometimes have multiple heads. Chimeras are usually identified and labeled by the species of their original animal (i.e. a horse chimera is a primordial horse that became chimeric with other animals features).

## Purebloods
**Pureblooded** primordials are the non-chimera Seath-born primordials, seen as colossal versions of their animal counterparts. They are known for having unique feeding patterns that have allowed them to avoid the more common chimeric mutation of other primordials.

- [[Goliath]], the great millipede

## Daemons
**Daemons** (also spelled demons) are primordials from other [[Places#Planes|planes of existence]]. There exists worlds beyond Seath completely dominated by primordials, enslaved to the "eat or be eaten" mindset. Primordials from other worlds are completely exotic to humanity in their appearance and abilities. Though few have made an appearance on Seath, those that are known have brought with them cataclysm and legions of daemonspawn.
