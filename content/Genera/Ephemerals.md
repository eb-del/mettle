**Ephemerals** are an abstract and diverse [[Genera|genus]], known for their their transient and temporary nature. The most widely recognized type of ephemeral are [[Eidolons#Ghosts|ghosts]].

# Description
Ephemerals are the antithesis to the ageless and immortal [[Eternals|eternals]]. Of the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|actor races]], ephemerals suffer the greatest casualties against the [[World Soul#Evicting Force|pressures]] of the [[World Soul|world soul]]. Ephemerals are purged regularly, some sent to other [[Places#Planes|planes of existence]], others simply dissolved and returned to the [[Thaumic Field|ether]]. 

Ephemerals embody the frailty in being incorporeal. For this reason, the types of ephemeral that seek longer worldly tenures are forced to rely on vessels, such as the earthenware pots of the [[Household Divinities|household divinities]], or as seen in an [[Eidolons|eidolon's]] ability to [[Eidolons#Possession|possess]]. Other types of ephemeral embrace their fleeting nature by design, serving singular purposes before disappearing, such as the human caricatures encoded in the [[Incarnates|incarnates]].

# Subgenera
Unlike [[Humans|humans]] or [[Animals|animals]], ephemeral subgenera do not reflect a physical classification, but rather a more general classification formed on the basis of an ephemeral's nature and origin (and by extension, their raison d'Ãªtre; reason for being). 

- [[Eidolons]]
- [[Incarnates]]
- [[Wisps]]

## Spirits
Spirits are a broad classification within the ephemeral subgenera, describing more independent, conscious, and free-willed beings. Spirits are not as beholden to their given nature as other subgenera of ephemeral, capable of individual growth and development. Though spirits tend to have longer worldly tenures than other types of ephemeral, the most venerable of spirits survive only a decade before facing dissolution.
