**Plants** are the most abundant and diverse [[Genera|genus]] on [[Seath]], known for being predominantly anodonic[^photo] (toothless; does not bite) and hydrophagic[^photo] (water-eating; does not eat food).

For the intersectionality with animals, see [[Zoophytes|zoophytes]].

# Description
In the present state of classifying organisms, plants are widely regarded as any organism with a predominantly vegetative, static state—thus including also molds, yeasts, and mushrooms (fungi)[^fungi]. With humanity's current state of the sciences, it is widely regarded that anything clearly not belonging to any of the other genera is a plant. 

# Subgenera
Compared to the other genera, plants have the largest number of [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenera]].

[^photo]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "anadonic" comes from the Ancient Greek "an-" (ἀν-) meaning not, without, lacking; and "odṓn" (ὀδών) meaning teeth; thus lacking teeth, toothless (in this context it means that plants don't eat by chewing with a mouth). The term "photophagic" comes from the Ancient Greek "hydr-" (ὑδρ-) meaning pertaining to water, hydration; and "phageîn" (φαγεῖν) meaning to eat; thus water-eating (in this context it means that plants are believed to only eat water). The combination of being "toothless" and "water-eating" are the fictitious precursors to the theory of photosynthesis, created in the absence of chemistry. In the real world, the components for photosynthesis wouldn't be discovered until 1779, when Jean Senebier discovered that plants converted carbon-dioxide into oxygen under the presence of light.
