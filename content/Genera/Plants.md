**Plants** are the most abundant and diverse [[Genera|genus]] on [[Seath]], known for being predominantly anodonic[^photo] (toothless; does not bite) and hydrophagic[^photo] (water-eating; does not eat food).

# Description
In the present state of classifying organisms, plants are widely regarded as any organism with a predominantly vegetative, static state—thus including also molds, yeasts, and mushrooms (fungi)[^fungi]. With humanity's current state of the sciences, it is widely regarded that anything clearly not belonging to any of the other genera is a plant. 

For the intersectionality with animals, see [[Zoophytes|zoophytes]].

# Subgenera
Compared to the other genera, plants have the largest number of [[Genera#Subgenera|subgenera]]. Plants are most broadly organized into **phanerogamae**[^phng] (singular: phanerogam, meaning visible seeds) and **cryptogamae**[^cptg] (singular: cryptogam, meaning hidden seeds; flowerless or spores).

Among the phanerogamae are the **gymnosperms** (naked seeds; flowerless, fruitless), the **angiosperms** (enclosed seeds; flowering, fruiting).

Among the cryptogamae are the **thalloids** (lichens, algae, molds), **bruons**[^brn] (mosses, liverworts, hornworts), **ferns**, and **mushrooms**.

[^photo]:![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "anadonic" comes from the Ancient Greek "an-" (ἀν-) meaning not, without, lacking; and "odṓn" (ὀδών) meaning teeth; thus lacking teeth, toothless (in this context it means that plants don't eat by chewing with a mouth). The term "photophagic" comes from the Ancient Greek "hydr-" (ὑδρ-) meaning pertaining to water, hydration; and "phageîn" (φαγεῖν) meaning to eat; thus water-eating (in this context it means that plants are believed to only eat water). The combination of being "toothless" and "water-eating" are the fictitious precursors to the theory of photosynthesis, created in the absence of chemistry. In the real world, the components for photosynthesis wouldn't be discovered until 1779 AD, when Jean Senebier discovered that plants converted carbon-dioxide into oxygen under the presence of light.

[^fungi]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The real-world formal separation of fungi from the plants was set in stone in 1969 AD, with Robert Whittaker's five-kingdom taxonomic system.

[^phng]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  The English word "phanerogamae" comes from the Ancient Greek "phanerós" (φανερός) meaning "visible"; and "gaméō" (γαμέω) meaning to marry; this visible marriage-parts (seeds).

[^cptg]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  The English word "cryptogamae" comes from the Ancient Greek "kruptós" (κρυπτός) meaning "hidden"; and "gaméō" (γαμέω) meaning to marry; this hidden marriage-parts (seeds).

[^brn]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**:  The word "bruon" comes from the Ancient Greek "brúon" (βρύον) meaning liverwort. In the real world, this subgenera represents the Bryophytes.
