**Technology** is the application of [[Humans|human]] knowledge into practical methods and goals, in a way that is reproducible. Technology encompasses invention, but also includes applied sciences, such as innovations in [[Languages|language]] and mathematics. 

It is believed that the production and proliferation of technology is a hallmark of the human race. 

# Magic
Though some consider [[Magic|magic]] as a type of technology, the difficulty in magical methods to be reproduced and iterated upon is the disqualifying distinction. Unlike the ability to further technology, the ability to wield magic seems to stem from an aptitude unrelated to one's capacity for innovation, understanding, and creativity.
