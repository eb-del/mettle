**Places** or **locations** constitute the named settings within the world of *Make and Mettle*. 

# Human Claims
As an [[OOU|out-of-universe]] convention for organization, [[Polities|polities]] (such as city-states) are not considered places, but instead as [[Factions|groups]] of people. For example, the city-state of [[Saramnatia]] relates more to the group of [[Humans|humans]] calling themselves "Saramnatian", not the place at which the Saramnatians have settled nor the territory in which the Saramnatians have inhabited. 

# Planes
A **plane of existence** (commonly known as a **plane**) describes self-contained, planet-like places throughout the *Make & Mettle* universe. Though they are planet-like, they cannot be seen or visited by any kind of [[Astronomy|astronomy]]; the ability to travel between planes freely is a luxury of the [[Eternals|eternals]].
