To the average person, **magic**[^mag] (also known as **sorcery**[^sorc]) broadly encompasses all mysterious and supernatural phenomena. To more empirically-minded practitioners of magic, there exists a more precise description of magic: as the behaviors and nuances of the [[thaumic field]].

It is believed by many that magic is not native to [[Seath]], acting in opposition to the natural order of the world. It is believed that magic stems from the otherworldly intervention of the [[Races#Actors and Agents|actor races]]; that magic is native to elsewhere. In [[humans]] (and certain species of [[animals|animal]]), magic has the unique property of interfacing with the [[psyche]] or soul—a fundamental relationship at the core of all forms of sorcery. 

# Practitioners
The most common and most broad term used for any [[Humans|human]] magic-practitioner is **sorcerer**[^sorc]. The term often carries the connotation of someone who uses magic to capture, bend, and weave fate; to oppose the natural order with one's ambition. This connotation can come with both praise and prejudice. The terms  **mage**[^mag] and **wizard**[^wiz] are alternative titles for sorcerers, typically associated with more experienced, older practitioners.

When an individual diversifies their responsibilities and areas of study beyond the use of magic (as is often encouraged), **philosopher** and **sage** are also sometimes used—sage in particular is often used for traditional, hereditary magic-practitioners from smaller chiefdoms.

In addition to these broader titles, there are also more specific, specialist titles from the many disciplines and subdisciplines of magic (such as pyrokinesist, a practitioner of [[Kinesis#Pyrokinesis|pyrokinesis]]).

# Disciplines of Magic

- [[Alchemy]], transmutation using magic

# Footnotes
[^mag]: [[OOU]]: The English words "magic" and "mage" has origins in the Ancient Greek word "magikós" (μαγικός), as in pertaining to the qualities of a "mágos" (μάγος), which itself is a borrowed word from Old Persian "maguš⁠" (written in cuneiform), a word referencing priests to the deity Mazda. 

[^sorc]: [[OOU]]: The English words "sorcery" and "sorcerer" ultimately comes from Latin "sors", meaning fate, from *reconstructed* Proto-Indo-European "ser-" meaning to bind, or thread. The notion of sorcery as "fate-weaving" comes from the etymological origin.

[^wiz]: [[OOU]]: The English words "wizard" comes from Middle English "wysard", meaning an individual who is wise. The conflation of wizards and magic did not appear until the 1500s.
