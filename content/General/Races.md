**Race** is an informal division of stakeholders in the world, discerned by their physical nature, design of the [[psyche]], place of origin, or ancestry. **Subrace** describes more specific classification within a broader **race**.

# Known Races
There are presently five known races, with a large number of subraces.
- [[Animals]]
- [[Ephemerals]]
- [[Eternals]]
- [[Primordials]]
- [[Humans]]

# Actors and Agents
One of the central sources of cooperation and conflict within the world of *Make & Mettle* is the relationship between the **actor races** (also known as the **triumvirate**; otherworldly interlopers: [[Eternals]], [[Ephemerals]], and [[Primordials]]) and the **agent races** (the natural, [[Psyche|soul-baring]] inhabitants of [[Seath]]: [[Animals]] and [[Humans]]). 

The world is naturally inhospitable to the actor races. Eternals are confined to foreign and exotic [[Places#Planes|planes of existence]], constantly forced to evade natural banishment. Ephemerals, similarly, are fleeting, phantasmal beings subject to a persistent and willful struggle against dissolution. Primordials are animals that have become afflicted with the powers and burdens of an [[Primordials#Primordial Curse|ancient curse]]; their existence a cancer to the natural world. All the actor races constantly endeavor to maintain a purchase upon the mortal world.

A common method of keeping this hold is for actor races to offer supernatural abilities in exchange for service from the agent races. Eternals often form [[Pantheons|systems of worship]]; Ephemerals often form individual, fleeting relationships; and Primordials often form blood pacts with [[Lineages|human lineages]].
