**Race** is an informal division of stakeholders in the world, discerned by any combination of their physical nature, design of the [[Psyche|psyche]], place of origin, or ancestry. **Subrace** describes more specific classification within a broader race.

# Known Races
There are presently five known races.
- [[Animals]]
- [[Ephemerals]]
- [[Eternals]]
- [[Primordials]]
- [[Humans]]

# Actors and Agents
One of the central sources of cooperation and conflict within the world of *Make & Mettle* is the relationship between the **actor races** (the [[Eternals|eternals]], [[Ephemerals|ephemerals]], and [[Primordials|primordials]]) and the **agent races** (the natural, [[Psyche|soul-baring]] inhabitants of [[Seath]]: [[Animals|animals]] and [[Humans|humans]]). 

The world is [[World Soul#Evicting Force|naturally inhospitable]] towards the actor races, evicting, enfeebling, or outright destroying them. For various reasons, however, the actor races still toil and persist to keep some hold, purchase, or influence upon Seath. 

A common method of keeping this hold is for the actor races to offer supernatural abilities in exchange for service or representation from the agent races. The eternals often form [[Pantheons|systems of worship]]; the ephemerals often form individual, fleeting relationships; and the primordials often form blood pacts with [[Lineages|human lineages]].
