**Race** is an informal division of stakeholders in the world, discerned by any combination of their physical nature, design of the [[Psyche|psyche]], place of origin, or ancestry. **Subrace** describes more specific classification within a broader race.

# Known Races
There are presently five known races.
- [[Animals]]
- [[Ephemerals]]
- [[Eternals]]
- [[Primordials]]
- [[Humans]]

# Actors and Agents
One of the central sources of cooperation and conflict within the world of *Make & Mettle* is the relationship between the **actor races** (the [[Eternals]], [[Ephemerals]], and [[Primordials]]) and the **agent races** (the natural, [[Psyche|soul-baring]] inhabitants of [[Seath]]: [[Animals|animals]] and [[Humans|humans]]). 

The world is inhospitable to the actor races. A natural force (likely the will of the [[Psyche#World Soul|world soul]]) repels them, not unlike an immune system responding to a pathogen. For various reasons, however, the actor races toil to keep some hold, purchase, or influence upon Seath. 

A common method of keeping this hold is for actor races to offer supernatural abilities in exchange for service or representation from the agent races. Eternals often form [[Pantheons|systems of worship]]; Ephemerals often form individual, fleeting relationships; and Primordials often form blood pacts with [[Lineages|human lineages]].
