> The ability to understand magic requires years of patience, decades of devotion, a lifetime of study. The ability to wield magic, much to our dismay, requires either unknowable aptitude or lucky happenstance. — Agamon, Basil of [[Magagora]].

To the average person, **magic**[^mag] (also known as **sorcery**[^sorc]) broadly encompasses all mysterious and supernatural phenomena. To more empirically-minded practitioners of magic, there exists a more precise description of magic: as the behaviors and nuances of the [[Thaumic Field|thaumic field]].

It is believed by many that magic is not native to [[Seath]], acting in opposition to the natural order of the world. It is believed that magic stems from the otherworldly intervention of the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|actor races]]; that magic is native to elsewhere. In [[Humans|humans]] (and certain species of [[Animals|animal]]), magic has the unique property of interfacing with the [[Psyche|psyche]] or soul—a fundamental relationship at the core of all forms of sorcery. 

# Disciplines
There are many disciplines in the study and practice of magic, many intersecting and overlapping.

## Magagoric Disciplines
The division of disciplines according to the [[Magagora#College of Magic|college of magic]] in Magagora is as follows:

- [[Alchemy]], transmutation using magic
- [[Antimagic]], countering and dispelling magic
- [[Cryptothesis]], esoteric fundamentals of magic
- [[Diagnosis]], magic into hindsight; appraisal, recollection
- [[Kinesis]], magic into kinetic energy
- [[Egersis]], resurrecting the dead using magic; soul magic
- [[Horasis]], magic into far-sight and surveillance
- [[Mantis]], magic into foresight; divination
- [[Morphosis]], magic into shape-shifting
- [[Phantasis]], magic into illusions
- [[Poiesis]], magic into matter

# Obscurities
**Obscurities** are any form of magic that evade all attempts at human understanding and replication. Unlike disciplines—which are studied extensively—obscurities cannot be dismantled; there are no sub-obscurities, and no obscurity can be explained through scholarly pursuit. Obscurities exist "as-they-are" as whole, complete, phenomena.

- [[Eunomoi]]
- [[Quirk Magic]]
- [[Unforgettable Ideas]]
- [[Communion]]
- [[Wanderwhimsy]]

# Practitioners
The most common and most broad term used for any [[Humans|human]] magic-practitioner is **sorcerer**[^sorc]. The term often carries the connotation of someone who uses magic to capture, bend, and weave fate; to oppose the natural order with one's ambition. This connotation can come with both praise and prejudice. The terms  **mage**[^mag] and **wizard**[^wiz] are alternative titles for sorcerers, typically associated with more experienced, older practitioners.

When an individual diversifies their responsibilities and areas of study beyond the use of magic (or those who have added magic to supplement an existing mastery), **philosopher** and **sage** are also used—sage in particular is often used for traditional magic-practitioners from smaller chiefdoms.

In addition to these broader titles, there are also more specific, specialist titles from the many disciplines and subdisciplines of magic (such as pyrokinesist, a practitioner of [[Kinesis#Pyrokinesis|pyrokinesis]]).

# Footnotes
[^mag]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English words "magic" and "mage" has origins in the Ancient Greek word "magikós" (μαγικός), as in pertaining to the qualities of a "mágos" (μάγος), which itself is a borrowed word from Old Persian "maguš⁠" (written in cuneiform), a word referencing priests to the deity Mazda. 

[^sorc]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English words "sorcery" and "sorcerer" ultimately comes from Latin "sors", meaning fate, from *reconstructed* Proto-Indo-European "ser-" meaning to bind, or thread. The notion of sorcery as "fate-weaving" comes from the etymological origin.

[^wiz]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English words "wizard" comes from Middle English "wysard", meaning an individual who is wise. The conflation of wizards and magic did not appear until the 1500s.
