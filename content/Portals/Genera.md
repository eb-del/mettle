A **genus**[^gen] (plural: **genera**, also commonly known as **race**) is an informal division of stakeholders in the world, discerned by any combination of their physical nature, design of the [[Psyche|psyche]], place of origin, or ancestry. 

# Known Genera
There are presently six known genera. While the boundaries between the genera are often clear, there exists intersections, such as in the [[Zoophytes|zoophytes]] (plant-animals).

- [[Humans]]
- [[Plants]]
- [[Animals]]
- [[Ephemerals]]
- [[Eternals]]
- [[Primordials]]


## Subgenera
A **subgenus**[^gen] (plural: **subgenera**, also commonly known as **subrace**) describes more specific classification within a broader genus. The distinction as to what defines a subgenus differs from genus to genus: The boundaries [[Humans|human]] subgenera are blurry, whereas the boundaries in [[Animals|animal]] subgenera are more concrete; speciated.

[^gen]:  ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: Ancient Greek in origin, the terms "genus" and "subgenus" come from the Ancient Greek word "génos" (γένος; featured in Aristotle's *Topics*) meaning stock, breed, kin; oriented primarily in the classification of animals. The use here contrasts modern taxonomy's usage of genus and subgenus, which are more motivated by evolution and genetics (as of yet undiscovered and undiscussed in this setting).
