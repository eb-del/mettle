A **genus**[^gen] (plural: **genera**, also commonly known as **race**) is an informal division of stakeholders in the world, discerned by any combination of their physical nature, design of the [[Psyche|psyche]], place of origin, or ancestry. 

# Known Genera
There are presently six known genera. While the boundaries between the genera are often clear, there exists intersections, such as in the [[Zoophytes|zoophytes]] (plant-animals).

- [[Humans]]
- [[Plants]]
- [[Animals]]
- [[Ephemerals]]
- [[Eternals]]
- [[Primordials]]


## Subgenera
A **subgenus** (plural: **subgenera**, also commonly known as **subrace**) describes more specific classification within a broader genus. The distinction as to what defines a subgenus differs from genus to genus: The boundaries [[Humans|human]] subgenera are blurry, whereas the boundaries in [[Animals|animal]] subgenera are more concrete; speciated.

# Eternal Contest
One of the central sources of cooperation and conflict within the world of *Make & Mettle* is the relationship between the **actor races** (the [[Eternals|eternals]], [[Ephemerals|ephemerals]], and [[Primordials|primordials]]) and the **agent races** (the natural, [[Psyche#anima|animate]] inhabitants of [[Seath]]:  the [[Plants|plants]], [[Animals|animals]], and [[Humans|humans]]). 

The world is [[World Soul#Evicting Force|naturally inhospitable]] towards the actor races, evicting, enfeebling, or outright destroying them. For various reasons, however, the actor races still toil and persist to keep some hold, purchase, or influence upon Seath. 

A common method of keeping this hold is for the actor races to offer supernatural abilities in exchange for service or representation from the agent races. The eternals often form [[Pantheons|systems of worship]]; the ephemerals often form individual, fleeting relationships; and the primordials often form blood pacts with [[Lineages|human lineages]].

# Footnotes
[^gen]:  ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: Ancient Greek in origin, the terms "genus" come from Aristotle's use of "génos" (γένος; featured in *Topics*) meaning stock, breed, kin; featured primarily in the classification of animals. The use here contrasts modern taxonomy's usage of genus and subdenus, which are more motivated by evolution and genetics (as of yet undiscovered and undiscussed in this setting).
