**Places** or **locations** constitute the named settings within the world of *Soltide*. 

# Human Claims
In general (and as an [[OOU|out-of-universe]] convention), settlements and [[Polities|polities]] (such as city-states) are not considered places, but instead as groups or [[Factions|factions]] of people. For example, the city-state of [[Magagora]] relates more to the group of [[Humans|humans]] calling themselves "Magagoran", and not the place at which the Magagoran have settled nor the territory in which the Magagoran have inhabited. 

The idea of a human settlement being a permanent place is still—like civilization as a whole—in its infancy, not unlike the seasonal nests of birds. These territorial claims are better known by their nearby natural features, such as rivers, mountains, or seas.

## Monuments
**Monuments** constitute the few artificial structures in the world that have lifespans rivaling mountains and rivers. Monuments can either be man-made, or created by any of the [[Themes#Eternal Contest|actor races]]. Some monuments even outlast the settlements that envelop them, such as the colossal [[Letheia]] and the ruined city-state of [[Acheriom]].

# Planes
A **plane of existence** (also known as a **plane**) describes self-contained, planet-like places throughout the *Soltide* universe. Though they are planet-like, they cannot be seen or visited by any kind of [[Astronomy|astronomy]]; the ability to travel between planes without cost or hinderance is a luxury of the [[Eternals|eternals]].
