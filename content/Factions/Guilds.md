[^gui]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "guild" comes from the Old Norse words "gildi", meaning guild or brotherhood, but also payment, tribute, contribution. From this etymology, one can surmise the meaning of guild as the group or party that ought be paid for services rendered. Of relating to payment or gold, see also the English word "gilded".

[^col]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "college" is from Latin "collegium", meaning an association of colleagues. The word "colleague" comes from Latin "collega", meaning partner in office, which is a combination of several Latin words and components: "com", meaning with, together; "leg", a stem from "legare" meaning to choose, gather, collect. Thus, to form a college is to simply form an association of peers that come together. Interestingly, the English word "collage" does not have a clear  etymological link with "college, instead derived from Ancient Greek "kólla" (κόλλα), meaning glue.
