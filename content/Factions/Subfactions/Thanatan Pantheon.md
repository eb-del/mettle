The **Thanatan pantheon**[^thano] is a [[Pantheons|pantheon]] that contains five [[Eternals]]: [[Hypone]], [[Agrypone]], [[Miserone]], [[Euthymone]], and [[Nycta]]; the [[Primordials|primordial]] millipede [[Goliath]]; and countless additional deified humans (known as archiaters). 

# Worship
In human worship, the Thanatan pantheon focuses on humanity's relationship with death. Hypone and Agrypone are competing eternals that embody a "sleeping death" (peaceful, without suffering) and a "waking death" (violent, with suffering), respectively. Miserone and Euthymone are competing eternals that embody emotions around death relating to dread (misery) or joy (euthemy), respectively. Nycta is an eternal without a competing pair, embodying "pure and complete death"—an ambiguous concept debated by Thanatan disciples; though popularly attributed to "death by forgetting".

Of the five Thanatan eternals, only Nycta provided written works to the discipleship, in her contribution and endorsement of [[Paramnestra|Paramnestra's]] *[[Paramnestra#Thanatothesis|Thanatothesis]]*.

A common belief among disciples of the pantheon is that none of the five Thanatan eternals inherently represent an ethical or moral death. Thanatan disciples believe that no single manner of death (and by extension, no single Thanatan eternal) should be preferred or sought after, fearing that one would be granted the opposite. Instead, Thanatan disciples instead teach individuals to seek a more ambiguous "worthy death" (granting access to the Thanatan [[Afterlife]]), which can only be obtained by thorough appreciation of one's own life, and fulfillment of one's living purpose.

The largest cohesive group of [[Egersis|evocators]] and [[Mantis#Necromancy|necromancers]] are among the Thanatan disciples. The largest institution of Thanatan disciples is known as the [[Letheia]], situated in the heart of [[Acheriom]].

## Archiaters
An **archiater**[^arc] is a deceased member of the Thanatan discipleship who has been posthumously granted institution-wide endorsement and sanctification, due to their contributions to the study of evocation and necromancy. 

Outside of the Letheia, Thanatan enclaves of study, service, or worship are often devoted to the veneration of an archiater. The focuses and practices of each enclave can vary greatly, even between those beholden to the same archiater.

# Footnotes
[^thano]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The title "Thanatan" comes from the Ancient Greek god of death, "Thánatos" (Θάνατος). Note there is no such singular god of death in this setting, but rather the collective formed by the five Thanatan gods (cooperating to form a singular authority for death). 

[^arc]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "archiater" is an archaic English word, with roots in the Ancient Greek word "arkhiātrós" (ἀρχῐᾱτρός), meaning chief official physician or responsible practitioner of a medical trade.
