**Rhaphania**[^rhap] is a [[Humans|human]] [[Polities|city-state]], located in a shallow basin where the [[Asterine River]] passes through the [[Parnithine Mountains]]. The city is most known for its reverence and extensive cultivation of the [[Palm Turnip]].

The demonym for a citizen of Raphania is **Raphanian**.

# Government
The Raphanian government is a partly democratic system, where a citizen-king is chosen by popular vote. The citizen-king holds very little executive power, however, and is primarily a diplomatic role, serving as the chief representative of the city to the rest of the region.

The citizen-king is elected from a pool from the members of the city assembly, who themselves are appointed through sortition. City assembly members have life tenure, but can resign willingly.

The eligibility for political participation (to be able to vote for the citizen-king and be in the lottery for sortition into the city assembly) is based upon individual contribution to the city's food supply—particularly a contribution of palm turnip. A standardized basket called a calathus[^cala] is used to measure dry volume, and a number of calathi worth of palm turnip are required for political participation. It is often the case for influential leaders to grant calathi of palm turnip (from their own familial holdings) to servant farmers in exchange for political favor.
