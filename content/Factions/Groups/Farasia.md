**Farasia**[^fara] is a [[Polities|confederacy]] of partly-nomadic [[Humans|human]] tribes occupying the [[Farasian Steppe]]. The confederacy is most known for its cold-accustomed people, recognized by their horse-mounted archers, hunter-pastoralists, and shamans. Protecting the people of the steppe is an unbound [[Primordials|primordial]], [[Khimore]], a horse chimera.

The term "Farasia" is an exonym first mentioned by scholars from the city-state of [[Saramnatia]]. The term was distributed and adopted by the Farasian tribes through the prominent fur trade of the region. A popular and historic endonym for the network of confederacies in this region is **Faikalia**[^faik].

The demonym for members of any tribe within the confederacy is **Farasian**.

# Government
As a confederacy of tribes, Farasia is loosely centralized in its administration and its management of resources. Farasia has a lengthy lengthy code of law established by a long precedent of cooperation, and a series of traditional, central values towards protecting the land. These factors have combined to produce a level of administrative cohesion otherwise impossible for other confederacies of tribes.

The sizable territory of Farasia is subdivided into claims where each tribe is responsible for that claim. Each tribe is typically a chiefdom. Relationships between Farasian chiefdoms are comprised of individually negotiated allegiances and personal networks of trust, rather than any obligation to a greater government or the idea of a state.

# Footnotes
[^fara]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Farasia" is not derived from the English words "far", as in distant, and "Asia", as in the real-world continent (despite obvious Siberian, Tibetan, Mongolian inspirations), but rather by the fictional, constructed words "fa" and "rasia". There are no real-world inspirations for these terms, despite the coincidental similarity to the Tok Pisin (New Guinea Pidgin) word, "Rasia", meaning Russia.

[^faik]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Faikalia" is a simple alteration of the English word "Baikalia", which in Russian is "Pribaykal'ye" (Прибайкалье), representing the geographic region around the real-world Lake Baikal. Faikalia is not the geographic region around an in-world "Lake Faikal", however.
