The city is most known for its mosaiced central avenue, [[Horasis|seer]] watchtowers, and signature ziggurat. The Orisir serves as a regional hub for [[Oric Pantheon|Oric]] worship and related religious services.

As a faction, the Orisir is aligned with the [[Oric Pantheon]] and the [[Orisir#Or dynasty|Or dynasty]]. The demonym for the citizens of the Orisir is **Orisirian**.

# Government
## Or dynasty
The **Or dynasty** is the [[Lineages|human lineage]] that has constituted the administrative and religious ruling class of the Orisir since the city-state's foundation. It is a well-kept secret that members of the Or dynasty are subject to a blood pact with the serpent primordial, [[Python]].

The central governing body of the Orisir is a council of elders, comprised of the five most senior members of the Or dynasty. At the head of the council of elders is the family patriarch, determined through patrilinear primogeniture.
