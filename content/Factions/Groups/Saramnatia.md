**Saramnatia**[^sar] is a [[Humans|human]] [[Polities|city-state]], located on the western shores of the estuary adjoining [[Lake Tyras]] and the greater [[Saramnatian Sea]]. The city-state is born from the organic co-mingling and merging of three coastal settlements, constituted by the three largest horsemen tribes of the region: the [[Arols]], [[Saramols]], and the [[Cyrols]]. Saramnatia acts as the de facto hegemon of nearly all smaller coastal settlements and chiefdoms across the shores of the Saramnatian Sea.

The demonym for the citizens of Saramnatia is **Saramnatian**.

[^sar]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Saramnatia" is a strong alteration of the Ancient Greek word, "Sarmatai" (Σαρμάται), referencing the Sarmatians, an ancient Iranian confederation of equestrian nomadic people—preceded by Sauromatians, from the Ancient Greek, "Sauromatai" (Σαυρομάται). Both names mean "armed with throwing darts and arrows".
