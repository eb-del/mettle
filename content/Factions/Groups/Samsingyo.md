The **Samsingyo**[^sam] (infrequently known as the **Southern Tritheon** or **Southern Triune**) is a [[Pantheons|pantheon]] that contains three [[Eternals|eternals]]: [[Dalnim]], [[Haenim]], and [[Gureumnim]]; as well as countless stellar beings and [[Household Divinities|household divinities]]. 

# Worship
Samsingyo disciples believe that the nature of the sky and the climate of the world are influenced by the passionate love between the moon, Dalnim, and the sun, Haenim. Their love was deemed so potent that it regularly attracts the curiosity of other stars (leading to constellations, comets, shooting stars, and the creation of the household divinities). Their most noteworthy recruit is named Gureumnim, the cloud herald. Originally a nebula, Gureumnim traded his natural starlight and godly freedom in order to be closer to [[Humans|humanity]], becoming the clouds of [[Seath]]. Here, he willingly grants mankind gifts of rain, shade, and wind. Gureumnim is temperamental, and prone to fits of rage, manifesting as storms, thunder, and lightning. 

Samsingyo disciples believe that all things belong in one of two worlds: that which comes from the ground (plants, animals, people, terrain, bodies of water) and that which comes from the sky (sunlight, moonlight, the stars, rain). It is believed mankind is entitled to all of that which comes from the ground, whereas everything that comes from the sky is earned or given by the three eternals.

## Fire and Light
In the Samsingyo belief, all fire (and often by extension, light) has divine origin, particularly that of the sun, the moon, and the stars. It is believed that the world began in complete darkness. Then, Haenim rose for the first time, creating day. When night returned, Dalnim offered moonlight as Haenim rested. The union between Haenim and Dalnim attracted the audience of countless stars, allowing starlight to be seen for the first time. Gureumnim, through the use of lightning, created fire that humanity eventually tamed.

It is encouraged among Samsingyo disciples to have a level of appreciation of fire present somewhere in their day-to-day lives. For this reason metallurgists, cooks, night watchmen, [[Mantis#Pyromancy|pyromancers]], [[Kinesis#Pyrokinesis|pyrokinesists]], and similar occupations are regarded as beloved trades in society.

[^sam]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The term "samsingyo" (삼신교) means tritheon or religious trinity, derived from the combination of the Korean words "sam" (삼), meaning three; and the final two characters "-singyo" (신교), found in both "dasingyo" (다신교) and the more archaic "beomsingyo" (범신교); the two meaning polytheism.
