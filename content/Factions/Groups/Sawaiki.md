**Sawaiki**[^sawa] is a [[Humans|human]] [[Polities|city-state]], and cultural home for the [[Manutoa]]. It is the only flying city in [[Seath]], and therefor is not associated with any particular geographic location.

The demonym for citizens of Sawaiki is **Sawaikian**.

# Government
Sawaiki is the most populous chiefdom in the world. Though Sawaiki is home to many families and individual, distinct [[Lineages|lineages]], the political dynamic of Sawaiki has a singular consanguineous nature. The chieftain of Sawaiki (also known as the matuqa[^mtq]) is the oldest Manutoan in residence, and culturally regarded by all citizens as a revered relative, regardless of true ancestry. Similarly, all citizens Sawaiki are addressed as descendants of the present chieftain.

The chieftain has a council of trusted members of Sawaiki society (familial leaders, the matangi[^mtgi]), often appointed from the most influential Manutoan families. Members of the council regard one another as siblings, and direct children of the present chieftain, regardless of true ancestry. All members of this council also are, by historic precedent, the most talented [[Kinesis#Aerokinesis|aerokinesists]] of their families.

Most often, the chieftain of Sawaiki is selected from among the council when the present chieftain passes. Uncommonly, elder heroes of Sawaiki have also been ascended as chieftains. The transition of becoming the chieftian of Sawaiki is considered a completely transformative one. In the ceremony of ascending a new chieftain, the chosen "dies and is reborn" as the chieftain, and the new reincarnated embodiment of the spirit of Sawaiki.

# Footnotes
[^sawa]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The name "Sawaiki" is a *reconstructed* Proto-Polynesian word, from which the Maori word "Hawaiki", the Samoan word "Savaiʻi", the Tahitian word "Havaiʻi", and the most familiar Hawaiian word "Hawaiʻi" are hypothesized to descend from. All of these words describe the mythological location believed to be (in multiple Polynesian oral traditions) where all Polynesian people originate from, and return to after death.

[^mtq]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "matuqa" is a *reconstructed* Proto-Polynesia word, from  which the Maori word "matua", the Samoan word "matuā", the Tahitian word "metua", and the Hawaiian word "makua" are hypothesized to descend from. All of these words describe a parent, elder, or someone old.

[^mtgi]:![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The word "matangi" is a *reconstructed* Proto-Polynesia word, from  which the Maori word "matangi", the Samoan word "matagi", the Tahitian word "mata'i", and the Hawaiian word "makani" are hypothesized to descend from. All of these words describe wind or breeze. Interestingly (and similarly), the Samoan word "matai" describes the holders of family chief titles in the Fa'amatai system (the historic political system of Samoa; whose name translates to "in the way of the matai" or "in the way of the families").
