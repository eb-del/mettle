**Acheriom**[^ache] is nearly-ruinous [[Humans|human]] [[Polities|city-state]], located at the center of the [[Asphon Plains]]. Though far from its original prestige, Acheriom maintains its legacy through its most noteworthy structure: the Letheia, the seat of significance for the [[Thanatan Pantheon|Thanatan discipleship]]. 

The demonym for the citizens of Acheriom is **Acherii**.

# Government
Acheriom has a very small population (including the Thanatan disciples), and as such has a very small administrative body. Present-day Acheriom is led by a singular "archon", democratically elected by the citizens of Acheriom. Traditionally, the archon of Acheriom does not have a position of leadership in the Thanatan discipleship. The government of Acheriom is distinct from the leadership of the Thanatan pantheon, and instead concerns itself with leading and organizing the citizens at the periphery.

# Letheia
The **Letheia** is the largest organized place of worship, study, and education for disciples of the Thanatan pantheon. To the region, the Letheia primarily serves as a hub for funerary practices and preservation of the dead, while also offering the services that Thanatan disciples are most known for: communion with the afterlife ([[Mantis#Necromancy|necromancy]]) and resurrection of the dead ([[Egersis|evocation]]).

Beneath the Letheia is a large catacomb network actively maintained by the disciples of the Thanatan pantheon. This catacomb network is also home to [[Goliath]], the primordial most associated with the Thanatan system of worship.

[^ache]:[[OOU]]: The name "Acheriom" is an alteration of the Ancient Greek word, "Acheron" (Ἀχέρων), referencing the river through the Epirus in northwest Greece. The Acheron, however, is more known for in its place in Greek Mythology, as the river that acts as the entrance to the underworld (not to be mistaken for the Styx).
