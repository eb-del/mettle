The **Oric pantheon** is a [[Pantheons|pantheon]] that contains no [[eternals]], but instead many deified [[Humans|humans]], primarily members of the [[Orisir#Or dynasty|Or dynasty]], and the broader leadership of the [[Orisir]]. 

# Discipleship
As a religion, the Oric pantheon portrays the members of the Or dynasty as a lineage with divinity in their blood. The powers granted to the Or dynasty via the blood pact with [[Python]] are disguised as a godly heritage, rooted in the lineage's founder, [[Or]].

Blood is a central motif to Oric worship. Oric disciples believe that a great deal of information about a person—their afflictions, their personality, their inclinations, their allegiances—could be discerned from studying their blood. Bloodletting is seen as both a treatment for illnesses and a natural step in enforcing the code of law.

In Oric faith, the heart is seen as the most vital organ of the human body. It is believed that secrets and one's capacity for treachery is stored in the heart. To die of cardiac arrest or heart complications is seen as divine punishment against harboring secrets. To die of poison, venom, or intoxication is seen as disgusting, improper, and as a weakness of character; only untrustworthy, insubordinate, or outright unlikeable individuals die in this way.
