A **lineage** is a group of individuals joined by a common ancestry. In [[Humans|human]] society, lineages (sometimes called **dynasties**) are often important for hereditary roles, such as in [[Primordials|primordial]] blood pacts. Lineages are usually traced either on the maternal line (matrilineage) or the paternal line (patrilineage).
