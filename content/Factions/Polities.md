A **polity**[^pol] is a group of individuals, typically [[humans]], that have formed a collective identity, with the ability to coordinate the movement and distribution of resources through the use of institutions (such as a government or other organization). **States** or **countries** (such as kingdoms, confederacies, and empires) are considered a more static form of polity.  See also [[Places#Human Claims|human claims]].

[^pol]: ![[Uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The English word "polity" comes from the Ancient Greek "polīteíā" (πολιτεία), meaning citizenship, state, government or administration. Polity is a doublet of the English words "policy" (positions of the state and law) and "police" (enforcement of the state and law).
