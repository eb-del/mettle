**Goliath** is a pureblooded millipede [[Primordials|primordial]], residing within the catacombs of the [[Letheia]]. Unlike other primordials, Goliath does not form blood pacts with humanity, instead sustaining itself (and its atrophying [[Psyche|psyche]]), by devouring the [[Ephemerals#Eidolons|ghosts]] that wander the catacombs.

# Description
## Personality
>"You mistake me for [[Python]], I'm afraid. A foolish mistake, really. The sound of countless footsteps should've given me away."
>â€” Goliath, in response to the ghost of an [[Orisir|Orisirian]] merchant

Goliath has a more symbiotic relationship with mankind. He believes that [[Seath]] and all of its inhabitants are part of a vast ecosystem of birth and decay; where he alone serves as the king of detritivores and decomposers. Goliath also believes that he provides an essential social service to the humanity, a salve to suffering: his appetite encourages ghosts to seek absolution and move on to their [[Afterlife]], rather than needlessly lingering among the living. Goliath believes that without his work in devouring the souls of the dead, the ambient magic in the world would gradually be depleted, as an excess of ghosts wander and torment the world.

Goliath has dismissive view of other human kings and other primordials, as across the countless he'd come to know, they all spoke only of legacies and living forever. Goliath feels lonely in that he has no true peers; ridiculing both humanity's and the other primordial's constant aversion and rage towards death. It is for this reason he has more respect for the disciples of the Thanatan pantheon, who, in Goliath's eyes, have more mature perspectives on death. Goliath has no ambition towards longevity, instead believing that death will claim him once his work is done.
