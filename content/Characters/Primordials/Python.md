**Python** is a pureblooded serpent [[Primordials|primordial]], residing within the caves beneath the [[Parnithine Mountains]]. A well protected secret is that Python is responsible for the rise to power of the [[Orisir#Or dynasty|Or dynasty]] and by extension, the founding and continued prosperity of the [[Orisir]].

# Description
## Personality
>"Myself and my kin are incapable of producing venom. Look into my mouth and see for yourself. If you feel any doubt in my allegiance to you, my king, recognize that this feeling you have—this uneasiness, the pressure, the breathlessness—is the work of those closest to you, conspiring to see you undone."
>— Python to King Giladdar, Fourth King of the Orisir

Python is known to be cunning, observant, and adept at long-term schemes. It is rumored that his long body slithering beneath the Orisir's streets grants him a tactile perception of the city, ever vigilant to gather insight, knowledge, and leverage. Python takes a keen interest in humanity's relationships and power dynamics, eager to tug at the strings and see what happens, purely for amusement.

As a primordial's lifespan is many times that of a human's, Python perceives the world at a far larger scope. Python recognizes that a relationship with humanity greatly increases his odds of survival, yet he does not feel beholden or reliant upon them. Inwardly, Python values human life purely as pieces to his favorite game. Outwardly, however, Python is cordial, polite, and willing to pretend to be weaker than he actually is, as to stoke the often easily manipulated egos of his human associates.

Over his life, Python has learned that treachery produces traitors, and thus has been the target of countless attempts at betrayal by members of his chosen lineage. Python views these acts as amusing, interesting, and encourages a good game, even rewarding masterful maneuvers against him. Thus far, however, despite not having feet, Python remains countless steps ahead—rarely do the schemes of humans surprise him. 

## Feeding Cycle
While other primordials are known for their colossal appetite, placing upon their chosen lineage the burden of constantly finding vast quantities of food, Python differs in that he only needs to be fed once every century. Instead of just any feed, however, Python demands the flesh of other primordials. 

Like his animal kin, Python relies on ambush and constriction of his prey to achieve his meal. Python guides the members of the Or dynasty to use diplomacy, intrigue, and treachery in order to suddenly ensnare another blood-bound lineage (and by extension, their hidden primordial backer). The result is a two-fold victory: on the surface, the Orisir fills its coffers through its new ties and expanding influence, while deep within the mountain, Python fills its belly for another century.
