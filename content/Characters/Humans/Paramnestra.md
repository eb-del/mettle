## Thanatothesis
Paramnestra, for most of her life, was an evocator (egersist) residing within the [[Letheia]], the largest institution devoted to the Thanatan pantheon. During her time there, Paramnestra would become lovers with a scribe by the name of [[Themis]]. Themis would later die of an unknown illness, leading Paramnestra to become reclusive and isolated for the remainder of her years, entranced in prayer within the deepest tomb of the Letheia.

A year after Themis' death, Letheia presented fifteen clay tablets to her fellow disciples. These fifteen clay tablets were collectively known as the *Thanatothesis*[^thano], and detailed various techniques to commune with the deceased that have departed for the [[Afterlife]]. Paramnestra would then go on to demonstrate the techniques in order to briefly communicate with the departed essence of [[Themis]]. At the time, this was considered a blasphemy in the Thanatan pantheon, as it was believed that once a psyche had departed for the afterlife, it had severed any binds to the living world—a state that many disciples believed should be sacred and untresspassed. 

For her blasphemy, Paramnestra was exiled from the Letheia, and forbidden from speaking to anyone within the Thanatan discipleship. Paramnestra would go on to use necromancy to offer guidance and foresight in the service of multiple rulers, despite the Thanatan pantheon's condemnation. Paramnestra would die of complications associated with old age, while in the service of [[King Armamino]].

Paramnestra would later be vindicated and marked an archiater of the Thanatan discipleship after the eternal, [[Nycta]], presented themselves at the Letheia. There, Nycta issued their endorsement of Paramnestra's necromancy by adding fifteen additional tablets to the *Thanatothesis*, marking the only time in history in which any of the Thanatan eternals provided written texts to mankind.

Paramnestra's *Thanatothesis* would go on to be the most important piece of literature kept within the Letheia. Copies of the *Thanatothesis* are considered an essential reading for any necromancer.

[^thano]: ![[uyu.svg|12]] **[[OOU]]**: The title *Thanatothesis* comes from the combination of Ancient Greek god "Thánatos" (Θάνατος), the god of death; and the term "thésis" (θέσῐς), meaning starting arrangement, placement, conclusion. See also [[Cryptothesis]].
